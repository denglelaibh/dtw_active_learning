Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that MRK may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for MRK is 25.18%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a breakout to the upside. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 5.50%, tells a similar story, and suggests that MRK currently trades in oversold territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) average trading volume of 14,822,205 during the past month is 61.58% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?MRK is currently undervalued by -16.91% relative to the average 1-year price target of $65.95 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.30, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for MRK over the next year.How risky is the stock? When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market.Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has a beta of 0.78, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. MRK therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, MRK average daily volatility was 36.48%, which is -18.39 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.
