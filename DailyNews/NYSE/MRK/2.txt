The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which is the best-performing index this year, had its biggest single-day drop since August as shareholders cashed in some of their winnings and bid up shares in health care companies and retailers. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost just less than 1 point to 2,626.07 and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.4 percent to 23,940.68. The Nasdaq lost 1.3 percent to 6,824.39.ANALYST’S TAKE: The decline in U.S. tech shares, driven by potential tax changes, is likely to weigh on Asian markets, said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. “The better than predictable Chinese November PMI figures were seen providing little to support prices given a market that mostly anticipates steady expansionary manufacturing figures,” said Pan. “Oil will take center stage with today’s OPEC meeting. While the realization of the technical committee’s recommendation may ensue, reactions could still be a wild card.”CURRENCY: The dollar strengthened to 111.98 yen from 111.90 yen. The euro gained to $1.1870 from $1.1847. (Source: Fox Business)Stock to Watch: Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK)On Wednesday, Shares of Merck & Co., Inc.
