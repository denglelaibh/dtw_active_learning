V’s ROI is 15.70% while MA has a ROI of 38.50%. The interpretation is that MA’s business generates a higher return on investment than V’s.Cash Flow 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
The value of a stock is simply the present value of its future free cash flows. V’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.92. Comparatively, MA’s free cash flow per share was +1.33. On a percent-of-sales basis, V’s free cash flow was 10.41% while MA converted 13.06% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, MA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskAnalysts look at liquidity and leverage ratios to assess how easily a company can cover its liabilities. V has a current ratio of 1.90 compared to 1.70 for MA. This means that V can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. V’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.67 versus a D/E of 0.84 for MA. MA is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationV trades at a forward P/E of 23.38, a P/B of 9.55, and a P/S of 13.77, compared to a forward P/E of 27.66, a P/B of 24.48, and a P/S of 13.13 for MA. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsA cheap stock is not necessarily a value stock. Most of the time, a stock is cheap for good reason. A stock only has value if the current price is substantially below the price at which it should trade in the future. V is currently priced at a -9.84% to its one-year price target of 122.28. Comparatively, MA is -8.23% relative to its price target of 161.64. This suggests that V is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for V and 1.80 for MA, which implies that analysts are equally bullish on their outlook for the two stocks.Risk and VolatilityBeta is a metric that investors frequently use to analyze a stock’s systematic risk. A beta above 1 implies above average market volatility. Conversely, a stock with a beta below 1 is seen as less risky than the overall market. V has a beta of 0.97 and MA’s beta is 1.22. V’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentAnalysts often look at short interest, or the percentage of a company’s float currently being shorted by investors, to aid in their outlook for a particular stock. V has a short ratio of 4.23 compared to a short interest of 1.98 for MA. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for MA.SummaryVisa Inc.

In terms of valuation, V is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings and book value, V is more undervalued relative to its price target.
