The ability of a company to meet up with its short-term obligations and be able to clear its longer-term debts is measured using Liquidity and leverage ratios. The current ratio for MA is 1.70 and that of EOG is 1.30. This implies that it is easier for MA to cover its immediate obligations over the next 12 months than EOG. The debt ratio of MA is 0.84 compared to 0.46 for EOG. MA can be able to settle its long-term debts and thus is a lower financial risk than EOG.ValuationMA currently trades at a forward P/E of 28.21, a P/B of 24.96, and a P/S of 13.53 while EOG trades at a forward P/E of 57.56, a P/B of 4.19, and a P/S of 5.75. This means that looking at the earnings, book values and sales basis, MA is the cheaper one. It is very obvious that earnings are the most important factors to investors, thus analysts are most likely to place their bet on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsThe mistake some people make is that they think a cheap stock has more value to it. In order to know the value of a stock, there is need to compare its current price to its likely trading price in the future. The price of MA is currently at a -6.43% to its one-year price target of 161.64. Looking at its rival pricing, EOG is at a -6.88% relative to its price target of 109.09. This figure implies that over the next one year, EOG is a better investment.When looking at the investment recommendation on say a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell), MA is given a 1.80 while 2.10 placed for EOG. This means that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for EOG stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentShort interest or otherwise called the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted is another data that investors use to get a handle on sentiment. The short ratio for MA is 1.95 while that of EOG is just 3.27. This means that analysts are more bullish on the forecast for MA stock.ConclusionThe stock of EOG Resources, Inc. defeats that of Mastercard Incorporated when the two are compared, with EOG taking 5 out of the total factors that were been considered. EOG happens to be more profitable, generates a higher ROI, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has a lower financial risk. When looking at the stock valuation, EOG is the cheaper one on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Finally, the sentiment signal for EOG is better on when it is viewed on short interest.var fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl,fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl_poll=function(){var r=0;return function(n,l){clearInterval(r),r=setInterval(n,l)}}();!function(e,t,n){if(e.getElementById(n)){fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl_poll(function(){if(window['om_loaded']){if(!fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl){fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl=new OptinMonsterApp();return fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl.init({"u":"7491.622174","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});}}},25);return;}var d=false,o=e.createElement(t);o.id=n,o.src="//a.optnmstr.com/app/js/api.min.js",o.async=true,o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=function(){if(!d){if(!this.readyState||this.readyState==="loaded"||this.readyState==="complete"){try{d=om_loaded=true;fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl=new OptinMonsterApp();fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl.init({"u":"7491.622174","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=null;}catch(t){}}}};(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.documentElement).appendChild(o)}(document,"script","omapi-script");
