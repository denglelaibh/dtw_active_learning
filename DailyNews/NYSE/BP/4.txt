Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockBP plc (ADR) (NYSE:BP) has had a nice rally of late. Buoyed by rising Brent crude prices, the BP stock price has risen 20% just since mid-August, reaching a two-year high in the process.But in a way, that run actually has confirmed my skepticism toward the stock, which I detailed back in February. Investors bearish on oil obviously would look elsewhere. Those bullish on oil, however, simply had much better plays.That’s been the case as Brent has cleared the $60 level. Statoil ASA(ADR) (NYSE:STO) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS.A,RDS.B) have provided similar returns over the past two months and far better performance year-to-date. Ecopetrol SA (ADR) (NYSE:EC) has gained 26% just in the last month, and once-struggling Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras (ADR) (NYSE:PBR) has outperformed BP stock as well.BP does offer an attractive dividend, which yields 5.9% even after the current gains. But it still has Deepwater Horizon liabilities left, and still has a higher breakeven point, and thus more risk, than most of its large-cap peers.And there’s still the internal hedge between the company’s upstream exploration efforts and its downstream retail and chemical businesses. It’s a similar profile to Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and it creates the same problem for BP stock. Income investors might like BP (though XOM’s 3.7% yield looks much safer). But energy bulls have much better options.Without question, there are worse stocks in the market than BP. And BP has had an impressive year so far, including a strong Q3 earnings report. Coming out of the Q1 earnings report just six months ago, BP was guiding for breakeven free cash flow at $60 Brent. That figure already has come down to $49 – while Brent has risen to $63.The company also announced its intent to start repurchasing shares on the Q3 call. As InvestorPlace contributor Bret Kenwell pointed out, the dividend itself had been in question ahead of the report. BP even moved to an optional ‘scrip’ dividend paid in shares of BP stock to ease some of the cash required for the payout. The move to buy back stock suggests management is much more confident in the dividend’s sustainability.Meanwhile, Deepwater Horizon liabilities are trending down from a guided $5.5 billion in 2017 to just $2 billion in 2018 and $1 billion a year after that. That frees up more of the free cash flow generated by BP for shareholder returns and for development of new plays, including the major Khazzan gas field in Oman.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/bp-stock-take-profits/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
