Menu Breaking news sponsored byBack in February, I wrote that BP plc (ADR) (NYSE:BP) might be a deep value play and that “buying it here at $34 seems like a decent long-term risk-reward scenario.” I liked what I was seeing, and it also appeared that BP could hold its own with oil prices in the high-40s. Sure enough, the BP stock price is now over $41 per share, so if you listened to me, you are sitting on a 22% return so far. And there’s more upside ahead.What we’ve learned in the past three years, since oil prices crashed, is which E&P companies can execute in this environment and which cannot. BP stock has proven it can and even said its break-even point is $42 per barrel. With oil at $49, it can cover both capex and dividend payments. Now, with OPEC getting its act together and the crisis in Saudi Arabia, oil prices seem poised to stay elevated for some time to come.The BP stock price is up because its earnings are also improving. In Q3, revenues rose a staggering 25% to $61 billion. Net income rose 10% to $1.77 billion. BP stock has now had five consecutive quarters of profit.Yet even more important than profit is cash flow, and cash flow from operations hit $6 billion this quarter, the highest in over two years and up 140% over last year. On that same note, the all-important free cash flow hit $1.89 billion. The last time it was anywhere that high was in Q2 of 2015. Since then it got as low as negative $2.5 billion.Meanwhile, BP stock has a solid cash position of about $26 billion. Yet the cash position plus free cash flow means that the $2.40 annual dividend looks intact. Still, BP needs to keep improving on this metric so that the $5.3 billion in paid dividends is covered by free cash flow.The BP stock price should also be helped by repurchasing shares again. This will reduce dividend payouts. Normally, I hate buybacks because most companies spend that money when their shares are vastly overpriced. BP stock, however, still seems like a value play to me.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/bp-strong-value-play-with-huge-upside/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
