"Maybe one day that future will take them into the energy industry where some of the fastest growing jobs in the U.S. can be found."NextEra Energy Resources and Xcel Energy have each committed $12,500 in school funding, which will be used to secure computer lab equipment and expand the school science, technology, energy, arts and math (STEAM) curriculum. The result of the investment will be the creation of the Kulm Public School K-12 SmartLab which will be installed at the school in the spring. The new SmartLab will offer an expanded curriculum in eight core technological competencies, including: energy, scientific data and analysis, and software engineering, among others."We're committed to the economic growth and future of the communities in which we operate," said Mark Nisbet, principal manager, Xcel Energy-North Dakota. "And we're especially delighted to be able to spur students' interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers through this grant from the Xcel Energy Foundation."Kulm Public School is home to approximately 140 K-12 students and currently competes in state-level STEAM events. At last year's state Science Olympiad competition, a Kulm 7th grade team won first place in the alternative energy category for their construction of a wind turbine. "Thanks to the generous donation of NextEra Energy Resources and Xcel Energy, Kulm Public School will be able to continue to achieve academic excellence in our STEAM programs," said Tami Kramlich, Kulm Public School superintendent. "It can be a challenge for rural schools to compete for resources with high-population school districts making this gift all the more impactful."NextEra Energy ResourcesNextEra Energy Resources, LLC (together with its affiliated entities, "NextEra Energy Resources"), is a clean energy leader and is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the U.S., with approximately 19,990 megawatts of generating capacity, which includes megawatts associated with noncontrolling interests related to NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:   NEP), primarily in 29 states and Canada as of year-end 2016.
