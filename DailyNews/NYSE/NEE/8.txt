NEE UTL AT PNM On Nov 15, 2017, we issued an updated research report on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report)	.The company is benefiting from its focus on clean energy. NextEra Energy has lowered emission levels and is trying to reduce energy bills for customers. However, impacts of unpredictable natural disasters remain a headwind. Notably, its $3-billion infrastructure investment in the last 11 years in Florida has cushioned it against significant electric infrastructure losses.NextEra Energy’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings surpassed estimates by 5.7% on the back of solid contribution and investments from its segments — Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) and NextEra Energy Resources (NER).NextEra Energy is on track with its business strategies. The company makes long-term investments in clean energy assets with plans to put in $40-$44 billion in projects during 2017-2020. In line with this strategy, the company announced plans to generate an additional 1,400-3,800 megawatt (MW) of solar generation in the United States over the next few years.NextEra Energy's current renewal energy development program aims at bringing 10,100-16,500 MW of new renewable projects online (including wind repowering) during 2017-2020.In the last two years, FPL has entered into agreements to shut two independent coal-fired power plants, with the aim of saving additional costs for customers. This is expected to result in $183 million in savings for FPL customers and reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 5.6 million tons.However, the company's business is subject to complex federal, state and other regulations. Additionally, its subsidiaries depend on regulatory bodies for rate relief and cost recovery approvals. As a result, NextEra Energy’s current capital projects might get hampered by delays. This will lead to cost overruns and hurt the company’s profits.Additionally, the company's subsidiary NEER's dependence on government policies and budgetary constraints may lead to delay and reduced returns through investment losses. Additionally, increasing indirect input costs are also among the other headwinds for the company.Price MovementNextEra Energy has outperformed the industry in the three months. The company’s shares gained 66.4% compared with the industry’s advance of 18.9%.Zacks Rank & Key Picks               NextEra Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Privacy Policy | No cost, no obligation to buy anything ever.Copyright 2017 Zacks Investment ResearchAt the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.Visit performance for information about the performance numbers displayed above.Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.Real time prices by BATS.
