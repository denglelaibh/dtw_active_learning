However, adjusted EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.The year-over-year decline in earnings was due to disappointing Retail/LTC numbers as well as lower margins.Without one-time adjustments, EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter came in at $1.26, down from $1.43 in the prior-year quarter.  CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     Surprise      CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      CVS Health Corporation Quote Net revenues in the quarter increased 3.5% year over year to $46.18 billion, almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong revenue growth in the Pharmacy Services segment was partially offset by a decline in Retail/LTC revenues in the quarter. Quarter in Details Pharmacy Services revenues increased 8.1% to $32.89 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in specialty pharmacy volumes, higher pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 8.3% to 374.2 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 66.9 million, up 6.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis on continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health's Retail/LTC dropped 2.7% year over year to $19.59 billion, primarily due to a 3.2% decrease in same-store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 2.8% year over year. Front-store sales were affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales also declined 3.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 435 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. Also, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes inched up 0.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 420-bps negative impact on same-store prescription volumes.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) increased approximately 100 bps to 87% at the Pharmacy Services segment and around bps to 87.2% at the Retail/LTC segment.Gross profit dropped 4.9% to $7.12 billion and gross margin contracted 140 bps to 15.4%. Total operating margin in the quarter declined 93 bps to 5.4%.CVS Health exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.56 billion compared with $2.16 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017.
