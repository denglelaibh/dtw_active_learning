PEORIA — For the second time in about a year, Caterpillar Inc. has introduced a new line of products that could as easily find a home in a residential garage as on a construction site.The company debuted two utility vehicles on Thursday — the gasoline-fueled Cat CUV82 and diesel-powered Cat CUV102D — that will be available through Caterpillar dealers next summer. Additional models are expected to follow.Both new utility vehicles, which look like heavy-duty golf carts painted Caterpillar Yellow, can haul up to 1,000 pounds and tow up to 2,000 pounds with four-wheel drive and top speeds of 45 mph for the gas engine and 25 mph for diesel.“We want this machine to feel stable at all loads, and it does a great job at that,” Campbell Lowman, with utility vehicle product development at Caterpillar, said during a live online event showcasing the vehicles for the first time.Like the new series of portable power units introduced in September 2016, the utility vehicles are Caterpillar designed and tested, but made by a third party. The utility vehicles were born from a manufacturing and supply agreement with Textron Specialized Vehicles Inc. and will be built at a Textron facility in Minnesota.And as with the home generator sets unveiled last year, the utility vehicles carry the Cat brand on and off job sites — and into the consumer marketplace.Lowman and Steve Schoening, Caterpillar’s utility vehicle product manager, said the vehicles and the 50 accessories that can customize them for specific job site needs were designed with Cat’s traditional work customers in mind, but the durability and dealer responsiveness that comes with the Cat brand also will appeal to customers who want the vehicles for recreational purposes.“We’re looking at construction applications, we’re looking at landscaping as well as ag,” Schoening said. “You can customize it to your own use.”But Lowman added, “We have taken this machine outside its comfort zone. It does very well off the worksite as well as satisfying the worksite needs.”Some parts and design elements of the Cat utility vehicles will be unique to those models and not used in any other Textron products, which include utility vehicles, all terrain vehicles, golf carts and snowmobiles manufactured in several different configurations under multiple brand names.Norma Aldinger, Caterpillar’s utility vehicle marketing supervisor, said a small group of dealers who have used the new machines remarked on how quietly and smoothly the vehicles operated.With that feedback and a utility vehicle market that is steadily growing, Aldinger said the decision to enter the market made sense for Caterpillar.“We just needed to do it, and the time is now,” Aldinger said.-- Matt Buedel can be reached at (309) 686-3154 or mbuedel@pjstar.com.
