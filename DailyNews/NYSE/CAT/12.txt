I'd never been startled by a dateline.Until this week.But there it was, on a story out of the world headquarters of Caterpillar Inc. As with most newspaper stories, it began with a dateline:DEERFIELD, Ill.Wow.Not PEORIA, Ill. But DEERFIELD, Ill.I guess I should've seen it coming.After all, we've known about the move. And we've complained about the move.But to see it in black and white? In a new dateline?Jarring. Unnerving.And forever.Sure, there will be Caterpillar stories out of Peoria, East Peoria and Morton, as well as other central Illinois towns. But when big news and announcements thunder globally out of corporate headquarters, the dateline will be DEERFIELD.Historically, datelines included exactly what the word implies: a date. But you don't see that much anymore. Rather, datelines today usually include only the city (and sometimes the state) of a story's origin. Some newspapers are persnickety about this process, mandating that a reporter do reporting (or at least make an appearance) in a city cited in a dateline. Other newspapers, including the Journal Star, see a dateline as reader friendly: our reporting done by phone or electronic device can result in a story with a non-local dateline, if it helps the reader better understand the context (including location) of the story.(Yeah, newspapers ponder and fret a lot about such things. Make all the "fake news" allegations you want, but most papers still strive for utmost accuracy, even with datelines.)That's not to say every reader always notices a dateline. I don't, especially with locally produced news: I assume it's from hereabouts. But if I see PEORIA while skimming news sites, I take note.That's what happened this week — but not at the sight of a PEORIA dateline, but its absence.You might've noted the Journal Star story this week about Cat's revenue expected to keep climbing in 2018. And often when Cat makes news, I check to see what other media are saying. As I skimmed the coverage, my eyeballs spotlighted two words: "DEERFIELD" and "Caterpillar."Whoa. Where's "PEORIA"?It was purely a gut reaction. I literally felt a zing, a shock. Maybe that sounds naive. But in Peoria you get used to certain things. When they change, it can feel like emotional whiplash.The source for the DEERFIELD dateline was a public-relations website. There are many of those sites, which tend to simply repeat corporate press releases.So I checked the Caterpillar website. The company's press releases started using DEERFIELD in September. It's unclear how much of the physical move has occurred, but enough to change a corporate dateline from six to nine letters.And as it turns out, even the Journal Star has used a DEERFIELD dateline, for an October story on a board of directors' vote regarding dividend payments. Like I've already admitted, I sometimes don't notice datelines, including that one. But even now, almost a month later, DEERFIELD strikes me as an interloper in a story about Cat in what used to be its hometown paper.It's a weird feeling. Maybe it's like when a kid gets a birthday card from a divorced dad, the first one with a return address from a different residence. Or maybe it's like the initial time seeing a married daughter's full name, which no longer includes the same surname as yours. To be honest, regarding the DEERFIELD dateline, I don't know exactly how to describe the feeling.All I know is, it doesn't feel right.PHIL LUCIANO can be reached at pluciano@pjstar.com, facebook.com/philluciano and (309) 686-3155.
