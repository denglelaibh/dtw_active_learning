ORENCIA® (abatacept) rheumatoid 
      arthritis data examine potential therapeutic benefit and cost 
      effectiveness in the treatment of patients with highly active, 
      progressive disease

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis study evaluates ORENCIA 
      efficacy at two years in patients 2-17 years old

New pipeline data reflect Company’s long-term commitment to 
      addressing unmet needs in autoimmune diseases

PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today confirmed that 34 abstracts related 
      to ORENCIA® (abatacept) and the Company’s immunoscience 
      pipeline will be presented at the 2017 American College of Rheumatology 
      and Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals Annual Meeting, 
      November 3-8, 2017, in San Diego. Building on its heritage of 
      discovering and developing medicines designed to help modulate the 
      body’s immune response to treat autoimmune disease and cancer, the 
      Company will share clinical and real-world ORENCIA data across 
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 
      active psoriatic arthritis, as well as pre-clinical and first-in-human 
      data from BMS-986195, an investigational Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) 
      inhibitor.1,2

      The Bristol-Myers Squibb data being presented will include new insights 
      about how ORENCIA impacts outcomes and treatment costs in patients who 
      exhibit key biomarkers of highly active, progressive RA, such as 
      anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), as well as analyses 
      evaluating the link between these biomarkers and certain advanced 
      disease hallmarks such as structural damage progression.3-8 
      Treatment retention and safety data in the real-world setting to be 
      presented adds to the growing body of evidence on ORENCIA,9,10
a selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator.
    
      “Bristol-Myers Squibb’s research continues to advance the understanding 
      of the relationship between biomarkers such as ACPA and disease 
      prognosis. These biomarkers play an important role in both 
      identification of patients facing highly active, progressive disease, 
      who traditionally have had poor prognoses, and their treatment plans,” 
      said Brian Gavin, Vice President, ORENCIA Development Lead at 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb. “The ORENCIA data we are presenting at the 
      ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting are reflective of our commitment to advancing 
      the science and addressing unmet needs in autoimmune diseases with the 
      ultimate goal of enabling personalized ‘right treatment for the right 
      patient’ approaches.”
    
      Beyond RA in adults, Bristol-Myers Squibb data evaluating the efficacy 
      and safety of ORENCIA in patients aged 2-17 with JIA followed for up to 
      two years will be presented,11 as will pre-clinical and 
      first-in-human data from BMS-986195, an investigational BTK inhibitor.1,2 
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an enzyme found inside certain 
      immune cells that plays a fundamental role in the immune response to 
      antigens, which are proteins recognized as foreign materials in the body.12,13

About Rheumatoid Arthritis

      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic, autoimmune disease 
      characterized by inflammation in the lining of joints (or synovium), 
      causing joint damage with chronic pain, stiffness, and swelling.14,15 
      RA causes limited range of motion and decreased joint function.14,15 
      The condition is more common in women than in men, who account for 
      75% of patients diagnosed with RA.14

About Orencia

Orencia is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing 
      major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural 
      damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with 
      moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Orencia may 
      be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
      antagonists.
    
Orencia is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in patients 
      2 years of age and older with moderately to severely active 
      polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Orencia may be used 
      as monotherapy or concomitantly with methotrexate (MTX).
    
Orencia should not be administered concomitantly with TNF 
      antagonists. Orencia is not recommended for use concomitantly 
      with other biologic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy, such as anakinra.
    
Orencia is intended for use under the guidance of a physician or 
      healthcare practitioner.
    
U.S. Indications/Usage and Important Safety Information for ORENCIA® 
      (abatacept)

Indication and Usage

Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): ORENCIA® (abatacept) is 
      indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical 
      response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving 
      physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active 
      RA. ORENCIA may be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with 
      disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than tumor 
      necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.
    
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA): ORENCIA® (abatacept) is 
      indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in patients 2 years of age and 
      older with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. ORENCIA may 
      be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with methotrexate (MTX).
    
Adult Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): ORENCIA® (abatacept) 
      is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA.
    
Important Limitations of Use: ORENCIA should not be administered 
      concomitantly with TNF antagonists, and is not recommended for use 
      concomitantly with other biologic RA therapy, such as anakinra.
    
Important Safety Information for ORENCIA® (abatacept)

Concomitant Use with TNF Antagonists: Concurrent therapy with 
      ORENCIA and a TNF antagonist is not recommended. In controlled clinical 
      trials, adult RA patients receiving concomitant intravenous ORENCIA and 
      TNF antagonist therapy experienced more infections (63%) and serious 
      infections (4.4%) compared to patients treated with only TNF antagonists 
      (43% and 0.8%, respectively), without an important enhancement of 
      efficacy.
    
Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions can 
      occur during or after an infusion and can be life-threatening. There 
      were 2 cases (<0.1%; n=2688) of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions 
      in clinical trials with adult RA patients treated with intravenous 
      ORENCIA. Other reactions potentially associated with drug 
      hypersensitivity, such as hypotension, urticaria, and dyspnea, each 
      occurred in <0.9% of patients. There was one case of a hypersensitivity 
      reaction with ORENCIA in JIA clinical trials (0.5%; n=190). In 
      postmarketing experience, a case of fatal anaphylaxis following the 
      first infusion of ORENCIA was reported. Appropriate medical support 
      measures for treating hypersensitivity reactions should be available for 
      immediate use. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction 
      occurs, administration of ORENCIA should be stopped immediately and 
      permanently discontinued, with appropriate therapy instituted.
    
Infections: Serious infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, 
      have been reported in patients receiving ORENCIA. Some of these 
      infections have been fatal. Many of the serious infections have occurred 
      in patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which, in addition 
      to their underlying disease, could further predispose them to infection. 
      Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of infection or 
      underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections. Treatment 
      with ORENCIA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious 
      infection. Patients should be screened for tuberculosis and viral 
      hepatitis in accordance with published guidelines, and if positive, 
      treated according to standard medical practice prior to therapy with 
      ORENCIA.
    
Immunizations: Live vaccines should not be given concurrently 
      with ORENCIA or within 3 months of its discontinuation. The efficacy of 
      vaccination in patients receiving ORENCIA is not known. ORENCIA may 
      blunt the effectiveness of some immunizations. It is recommended that 
      JIA patients be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement 
      with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating therapy with 
      ORENCIA.
    
Use in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Adult 
      COPD patients treated with ORENCIA developed adverse events more 
      frequently than those treated with placebo, including COPD 
      exacerbations, cough, rhonchi, and dyspnea. In adult RA studies, 97% of 
      COPD patients treated with ORENCIA developed adverse reactions versus 
      88% treated with placebo and respiratory disorders occurred more 
      frequently in patients treated with ORENCIA compared to those on placebo 
      (43% vs 24%, respectively), including COPD exacerbation, cough, rhonchi, 
      and dyspnea. A greater percentage of adult RA patients treated with 
      ORENCIA developed a serious adverse event compared to those on placebo 
      (27% vs 6%), including COPD exacerbation [3 of 37 patients (8%)] and 
      pneumonia [1 of 37 patients (3%)]. Use of ORENCIA in patients with RA 
      and COPD should be undertaken with caution, and such patients monitored 
      for worsening of their respiratory status.
    
Blood Glucose Testing: ORENCIA for intravenous administration 
      contains maltose, which may result in falsely elevated blood glucose 
      readings on the day of infusion when using blood glucose monitors with 
      test strips utilizing glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline quinone 
      (GDH-PQQ). Consider using monitors and advising patients to use monitors 
      that do not react with maltose, such as those based on glucose 
      dehydrogenase nicotine adenine dinucleotide (GDH-NAD), glucose oxidase 
      or glucose hexokinase test methods. ORENCIA for subcutaneous (SC) 
      administration does not contain maltose; therefore, patients do not need 
      to alter their glucose monitoring.
    
Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of 
      ORENCIA use in pregnant women and the data with ORENCIA use in pregnant 
      women are insufficient to inform on drug-associated risk. A pregnancy 
      registry has been established to monitor pregnancy outcomes in women 
      exposed to ORENCIA during pregnancy. Healthcare professionals are 
      encouraged to register patients by calling 1-877-311-8972.
    
Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of 
      abatacept in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the 
      effects on milk production. However, abatacept was present in the milk 
      of lactating rats dosed with abatacept.
    
Most Serious Adverse Reactions: Serious infections (3% ORENCIA vs 
      1.9% placebo) and malignancies (1.3% ORENCIA vs 1.1% placebo).
    
Malignancies: The overall frequency of malignancies was similar 
      between adult RA patients treated with ORENCIA or placebo. However, more 
      cases of lung cancer were observed in RA patients treated with ORENCIA 
      (0.2%) than those on placebo (0%). A higher rate of lymphoma was seen 
      compared to the general population; however, patients with RA, 
      particularly those with highly active disease, are at a higher risk for 
      the development of lymphoma. The potential role of ORENCIA in the 
      development of malignancies in humans is unknown.
    
Most Frequent Adverse Events (≥10%): Headache, upper respiratory 
      tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and nausea were the most commonly 
      reported adverse events in the adult RA clinical studies. Other events 
      reported in ≥5% of JIA patients were diarrhea, cough, pyrexia, and 
      abdominal pain. In general, the adverse events in JIA and adult PsA 
      patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult RA 
      patients.
    
Note concerning ORENCIA administration options: Intravenous 
      dosing has not been studied in patients younger than 6 years of age. The 
      safety and efficacy of ORENCIA ClickJect™ Autoinjector for subcutaneous 
      injection has not been studied in patients under 18 years of age.
