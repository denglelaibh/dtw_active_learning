Having worked out of Work-Bench's 32,000 sq. ft. workspace in Union Square, we've seen first-hand how quickly well-vetted enterprise technology startups can add tremendous value to our organization, and through their executive briefings and corporate roundtables, Work-Bench and the tech ecosystem has helped us stay ahead of the technology curve, keeping us plugged in on emerging solutions and informed on what our peers are thinking through."According to Tomoaki Nakayama, General Manager of IT Innovation at SMFG, "Work-Bench has been instrumental in helping us keep a pulse on the trends driving the early-stage enterprise technology in New York City.
