The two additional truckloads are set to show up at the location within the coming days.Anheuser Busch says that the canned water comes from its brewery in Cartersville, Ga. This facility takes time throughout the year to stop production of beer and focus on producing cans of water. The water being sent to Hurricane Harvey victims is some that the brewery already had ready for emergencies.“Putting our production and logistics strengths to work by providing safe, clean drinking water is the best way we can help in these situations” Bill Bradley, Vice President for Community Affairs at Anheuser Busch, said in a statement.Anheuser Busch also provided an update on its employees in the path of Hurricane Harvey.

Gas prices in the U.S. are expected to spike once the hurricane is done. However, they shouldn’t remain up for long.BUD stock was up slightly as of noon Tuesday.As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/08/anheuser-busch-canned-water-hurricane-harvey-bud/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
