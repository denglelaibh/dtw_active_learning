Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockThe fourth quarter of the year is always a big one for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), though for different reasons. Amazon.com is the beneficiary of the swell of holiday gift-giving purchases, while Alibaba is the go-to middleman for China’s so-called Singles Day … a self-indulgent day of spending on yourself.It begs the question for many current or prospective owners of BABA stock though: Just how big of a deal is Singles Day?It’s huge (the specific number waits below), but not just for Alibaba anymore, and not just because Alibaba gets to sell tons of merchandise. This year’s Singles Day event will also be a chance for Alibaba CEO Jack Ma to put a new strategy to the test and simultaneously expand the company’s reach.For the record, Singles Day started out as something of a joke in 1993 when single students at Nanjing University felt they were being unfairly missing the special attention couples give one another on Valentine’s Day. The date for Singles Day is always Nov. 11, or 11/11, as the number one, of course, is by definition single. It’s also said that 11/11 evokes “bare branches,” a Chinese expression for single people.With a little help from Alibaba back in 2013, Singles Day has since morphed into a nationwide shopping event, though Alibaba captures the lion’s share of the drummed-up business.And this year is expected to be another doozie that BABA stock holders can get excited about. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey reckons the company’s gross merchandise sales volume could grow on the order of 35% year-over-year, from last year’s $17.8 billion to around $24 billion this time around.For perspective, the United States’ Black Friday weekend only generated about $8 billion worth of e-commerce last year.While the incredible sales growth has made and will make for riveting headlines, simple revenue generation isn’t the only thing Ma has on his mind anymore, nor is it the only matter BABA stock holders should chew on.It has been in the works for a while, evolving, but Alibaba’s “new retail” platform is going to be put to the test in earnest this year. Namely, about a tenth of China’s 6,000,000 convenience stores will be selling goods online through Alibaba’s platform, and letting those stores fulfill any required shipping.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/big-singles-day-alibaba-group-holding-ltd-baba-stock/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
