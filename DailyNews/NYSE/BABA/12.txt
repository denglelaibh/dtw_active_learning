BABA – Alibaba’s growth this year has been incredible, and critics are doubtful the gains can continue.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has more than doubled in 2017, as the Chinese superpower continues to dominate the e-commerce world — and a growing share of other sectors — throughout Asia.As is typically the case when a stock surges this much this quickly, critics are crawling out of the woodwork to predict a downturn. But as the The Motley Fool notes, BABA’s growth may only just beginning:The e-commerce giant’s reach is undeniable. It has reached 488 million active customers over the past four quarters. Several analysts have been jacking up their price targets in recent weeks, keeping up with the perpetually improving fundamentals. Alibaba stock isn’t cheap on an absolute basis, trading at 38 times this fiscal year’s projected profit and a still-steep 29 times next year’s analyst profit target. However, it is growing faster than those multiples at the moment. Some of the Alibaba bashers have been wrong all the way up, and while the stock gains only stretch their valuation arguments, one can also argue that if the metrics they claim are too good to be true are legit, then we may just be scratching the surface on the stock gains. Alibaba’s on a roll in 2017, and momentum is still on the side of the bulls.Perhaps that’s the only leg that BABA bears have left to stand on: questioning the company’s accounting practices. Because if their numbers are legit, we’re likely in for a lot more gains next year.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd shares closed at $191.19 on Friday, up $1.35 (+0.71%). Year-to-date, BABA has gained 117.73%, versus a 18.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.BABA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 77 stocks in the China category.
