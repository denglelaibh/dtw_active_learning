Menu Breaking news sponsored byU.S. stock futures are trading broadly lower this morning, as Wall Street worries about a deepening decline. Both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are coming off their first weekly losses in two months, as stocks retreat from lofty valuations. Washington remains front and center, as Congressional Republicans continue to flounder over a tax reform deal that has grown increasingly unpopular among constituents.Against this backdrop, Dow futures are down 0.34%, S&P 500 futures are down 0.28% and Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.39%.On the options front, puts gained in popularity on Friday, with about 16.5 million calls and 15.3 million puts crossing the tape. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arrived at 0.66, with the 10-day moving average ticking higher to 0.64.As for Friday’s options activity, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) drew heavy call volume in the wake of blowout third-quarter earnings. Meanwhile, JD.com Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ:JD), which also reported earnings this morning, and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) were active ahead of Singles Day, the biggest shopping day of the year in China.Nvidia said Friday morning that it earned $1.33 per share in the third quarter, blowing past the consensus estimate for 95 cents per share. Revenue came in at $2.64 billion, up 32% year-over-year and handily beating expectations for $2.37 billion. “We had a great quarter across all of our growth drivers,” said CEO Jensen Huang in the company’s press release.NVDA stock jumped more than 5% following the news, and options traders loaded up on calls while chasing the rally. Volume leapt to 484,000 contracts, nearly quadrupling the stock’s daily average. However, calls only made up 56% of the day’s take.This lack of enthusiasm from options traders is reflected in the November put/call open interest ratio, which now rests at 0.94 for NVDA. Despite the strong showing in the earnings confessional, options traders appear to be betting on a retreat for NVDA heading into Friday’s November options expiration.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/monday-vital-data-nvidia-corporation-nvda-jd-com-inc-adr-jd-alibaba-group-holding-ltd-baba/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
