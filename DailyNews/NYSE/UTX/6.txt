Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that UTX may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for UTX is 45.62%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 8.99%, tells a different story, and suggests that UTX currently trades in oversold territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. United Technologies Corporation (UTX) average trading volume of 2,619,563 during the past month is 13.22% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?UTX is currently undervalued by -7.09% relative to the average 1-year price target of $125.83 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.70, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for UTX over the next year.How risky is the stock? Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk.United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) has a beta of 1.06, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole.
