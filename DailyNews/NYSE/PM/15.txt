PM It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report)	. Shares have lost about 5.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Philip Morris Misses Q3 Earnings & Sales, Lowers ViewAfter reporting weaker-than-expected results in the first half of 2017, Philip Morris continued with its dismal performance in the third quarter. Both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter 2017 results. Moreover, the company also lowered its earnings guidance for 2017.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of $1.27 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39. While the company benefited from strong pricing and growth in Reduced Risk Products, lower cigarette volumes hurt its performance. Nevertheless, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter inched up 1.6% from the year-ago period.Net revenue, excluding excise taxes, was $7,473 million, which increased 7% (up 9% excluding unfavorable currency of $136 million) in the third quarter. Favorable pricing and volume/mix in the quarter drove revenues. While, revenue increased across Asia, Latin America & Canada and the European Union (EU), the same had declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA).During the quarter, revenues from combustible products declined 3.6% (down 4.6% excluding negative currency) to $6.5 billion. On the contrary, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) reported a whopping increase from last-year quarter, stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products. The company generated revenues of $947 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $212 million reported last year.However, net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,616 million.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 0.5% to 208.2 billion units. The figures were unfavorable in the EU, EEMA region and in Latin America & Canada mainly owing to low cigarette shipment volumes. These were offset by increased volumes in Asia, as well as higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across all regions. While cigarette shipment volume declined 4.1% in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.7 billion units, increased significantly from 2.1 billion units recorded in third-quarter 2016.Adjusted operating companies income was up 2.2% year over year to $3.1 billion due to favorable pricing and growth witnessed in Asia. Excluding currency impact of $140 million, adjusted operating income increased 6.8%. However adjusted operating margin was down 190 basis points to 42%.Segment DetailsEuropean Union: Net revenue in the European Union region increased 0.2% year over year to $2.2 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, net revenue declined 2.2%, mainly driven by unfavorable volume/mix in France, Spain, U.K. and Germany, which were partly offset by Italy.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 7.6%. Adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding favorable currency, decreased by 2.8 points to 48.1%.Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA): Net revenue in EEMA region decreased 7.9% year over year to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, net revenue declined 2.4%, principally driven by unfavorable volume/mix which reflects lower markets and market share in Russia and Saudi Arabia. These were partially offset by favorable pricing variance.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased 11.7%. Adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 4.8 points to 44.9%.                                                  Asia: The company recorded net revenue growth of 27.8% to $2.7 billion in Asia.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm.

A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.Visit performance for information about the performance numbers displayed above.Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.Real time prices by BATS.
