Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that PM may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for PM is 36.46%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure.
