The company hopes to break ground early next year, with an expected move-in date toward the end of 2019, spokeswoman Christa Burkhalter said.American Express' current main Valley employment center, in a leased building on North 31st Avenue, is aging, "so there's an opportunity to utilize land we already own," she said. "This shows the investment the company is making in its people and the Phoenix community."The financial-services giant, headquartered in New York, still will keep some employees at other buildings at the 31st Avenue campus. It already has some staff working in other facilities at the Desert Ridge campus. Various employees in customer service, fraud detection, collections and other business areas will make the move east to the new campus, which currently houses staff dedicated to fraud detection, risk assessment, technology and other areas, Burkhalter said.American Express ranked as Arizona's 20th-largest non-government employer with more than 7,300 workers in a report compiled earlier this year by The Arizona Republic. The company's current statewide count is around 7,000 people, Burkhalter said.Reach the reporter at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.READ MORE:Insys founder Kapoor sued by New Jersey over opioid marketing campaignArizona DACA recipient among Forbes' 30 Under 30 classWith help from Bill Gates, metro Phoenix's growth shifting to far west
