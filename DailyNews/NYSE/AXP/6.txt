With the latest tax reform proposal in Congress, it could get even more expensive.The proposal would eliminate the historic preservation tax incentive that has been around since 1976. Many are concerned that fewer groups will make preservation a priority if the bill becomes law.One company that has been committed to preservation for decades is American Express. Since 1974, the credit company has spent almost $60 million on preserving America's history.This year, American Express sponsored the Partners in Preservation: Main Streets competition. They are granting $1.5 million to 11 different preservation sites around the country. Tim McClimon, President of the American Express Foundation, shared how the winners were selected, and why giving back is so important to American Express.November 30, 2017November 30, 2017November 30, 2017November 30, 2017November 30, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 29, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 28, 2017November 27, 2017November 27, 2017November 27, 2017November 27, 2017November 27, 2017November 27, 2017November 27, 2017November 27, 2017November 24, 2017November 24, 2017November 24, 2017
