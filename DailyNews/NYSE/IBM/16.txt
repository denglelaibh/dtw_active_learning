Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that IBM may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of IBM’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for IBM is 42.56%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 9.46%, tells a different story, and suggests that IBM currently trades in oversold territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) average trading volume of 5,151,905 during the past month is 21.55% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?IBM is currently undervalued by -10% relative to the average 1-year price target of $163.45 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.70, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for IBM over the next year.How risky is the stock? When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has a beta of 0.94, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. IBM therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, IBM average daily volatility was 8.19%, which is 10.8 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.
