Menu Breaking news sponsored byThe challenges surrounding International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) are well-known at this point. IBM news isn’t great: most notably, revenue has declined year-over-year for 23 consecutive quarters. The IBM stock price hit a 52-week low in August; even after a recent rebound, the stock still is down about 30% from 2013 highs.But with IBM stock pulling back despite a strong Q3 earnings report, it’s starting to look tempting. The company’s “strategic imperative” revenue is growing and moving toward half of total sales. IBM stock is cheap, trading at under 11x 2017 adjusted EPS guidance. And a nearly 4% dividend yield makes the stock potentially attractive to income investors.There are concerns here, and IBM is a bit of an odd stock: a tech and even “cloud” play that trades like an old-line, low-growth industrial. It might be too risky for dividend seekers looking for safety, and too challenged for tech investors searching for growth. But as IBM stock “fills the gap” downward after a post-earnings pop, a 4% yield and a decent valuation make it interesting at least.It’s too early to assume the turnaround at IBM is on the way, but the company is making progress. Q3 revenue declined just 0.4% year-over-year, albeit with modest help from the weaker dollar. Strategic imperative revenue (basically, the company’s growing businesses like cloud, analytics, mobile, and security) totals over 44% of the trailing twelve-month total.It’s been a slow grind. Again, IBM is on track for its sixth consecutive year of declining overall sales, but IBM is getting to the point where more of its business is growing than declining. That, in turn, positions the company for potentially ending that multi-year trend as soon as 2018. Street estimates project a 0.1% decline next year.And there are pockets of real growth here. “As a service” revenue is at a $9.4 billion annual run rate, up 25% year-over-year. Cloud revenue over the past year has grown the same amount. Consulting and mainframes remain weak, but IBM is starting to execute in some of the more intriguing areas in tech. Overall, strategic imperative revenue grew 10% in Q3, up from 7% the quarter before.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/ibm-stock-downside-intriguing/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
