And unlike previous attempts to use the stevia leaf as a sugar substitute, it doesn’t have an aftertaste that some consumers find unpleasant, the company said during an investor event on Thursday.Coca-Cola with Stevia The trick was removing molecules that caused the taste -- something that Coca-Cola previously masked by adding a small amount of sugar. An earlier attempt, Coca-Cola Life, is sweetened with both stevia and cane sugar and has 60 calories.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc. are locked in a high-stakes contest to find more palatable alternatives to sugar. Many consumers have shunned earlier sweeteners like aspartame, and sugar itself has been blamed for contributing to the obesity epidemic.

Its success there may determine whether Americans get their own chance to taste it.
