The truck was due to pull into Gainsborough at 11am but didn't pitch up until just after 1pm where 1,000 people were waiting, Lincolnshire Live reports. A spokesman for Coca-Cola Great Britain said: “Unfortunately our driver took a wrong turn earlier today and had to turn on a very narrow road."We apologise to the fans who have been waiting since earlier today.”Becky French, who posted the photo on Facebook, wrote: "The truck is stuck! Issues with the lorry basically means its stuck in a field."Andrew Davies wrote: "Typical of Gainsborough's luck."Alison Hall, manager of Marshall's Yard, said: "We are disappointed for the people who had arrived at 11am waiting to see it."We are sorry that it was late but it's one of those unfortunate things."I do know the team have worked really hard to get it here as soon as possible."Since 2011, the truck has embarked on a whistle-stop tour of the UK in the run-up to Christmas with excited youngsters handed free sugary drinks.This year, the lorry will visit 42 locations across Britain with its final appearance at Essex's Lakeside Shopping Centre on December 17.Last January, health experts called for the tour to be banned amid claims it encouraged obesity.But Coca-Cola shrugged off the criticism and said it was "difficult to understand" why banning the truck would drive an improvement in public health.The company cited government data which showed sugar intake from soft drinks by children and teenagers was in decline.The 'Holidays are Coming' Christmas advert featuring the truck has been a festive staple since it graced the nation's TV screens in 1995.
