There will be a new destination for the Coca-Cola truck when it comes to Birmingham this Christmas We are part of the Trust ProjectThe Coca-Cola truck is coming to Birmingham before Christmas – and it’s got a brand new location.The big red truck is run by the US soft drinks’ giant credited with giving Santa his famous red suit.When the dates were announced for its visit to Birmingham this year, it was expected to be going to its usual berth close to St Martin’s Church in the Bullring.But with a carousel in between the church and Selfridges this year, there isn’t as much room as usual on that side of town.And so, thanks to the success of Ice Skate Birmingham’s Ice Rink and Big Wheel at its own brand new location off Park Street, the Mail understands the Coca-Cola truck will be parking up next to it on the edge of Eastside City Park.Now in its seventh year of operation, the truck is set to be there on the weekend of December 9 and 10 when Coca-Cola reps will be handing out free drinks.The news was welcomed by Ice Skate Birmingham’s Emily Danter whose husband AB (Abraham) helped to get the Park Street site up and running in just three weeks.In September, the Mail reported that the city council had not found a viable alternative site to Ice Skate Birmingham’s usual position in Centenary Square, which is being redeveloped as part of a £10 million regeneration scheme.But the Danters argued the case for Eastside Green and, once the land situation was resolved – it’s due to be part of HS2 – the couple then worked round the clock to develop the site after only getting permission to use it at short notice.Emily said: “Having the Coca-Cola truck next to the Big Wheel will be just another great reason for families to come down to our site.“This is not only our first year at Eastside Green, which gives a whole new view of the city for riders on the wheel, but it’s also the first year we’ve been able to put a roof over the ice rink.“This means that the ice will always be in much better condition than it was in the open air in Centenary Square.“Rain doesn’t do an ice rink any favours, but the combination of our new roof and the recent cold, crisp weather is keeping the surface tip-top.“We’ve also had the space to install a Wild Mouse rollercoaster and Dodgems at Eastside Green as well as various food and drink stalls and the whole site is covered with 12,000 square fee of artificial grass.“With free admission to the site and being just five minutes’ walk from Moor Street station, there’s never been a better time to come and visit us.“We would strongly advise people to book their skating slots at all times because the ice is now so good, but particularly when the Coca-Cola truck is here which will bring even more people down to come and see us.”Ice Skate Birmingham had to close down the site on Wednesday evening because of high winds, but it was back open again at 10am on Thursday.Emily said at the time: “The safety of our customers is paramount at all times.”
