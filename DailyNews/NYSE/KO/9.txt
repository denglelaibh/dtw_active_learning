Few things are as gruesome as the child of Wahhabism and hyper-Capitalism, which is now born - Coca-Cola’s new advert for Saudi Arabia, hashtag #changehasaface. It's based on the liberalisation of the kingdom’s driving laws, which mean that you can now drive a car in Saudi Arabia while suffering the disability of being female.In an endless desert a father teaches his daughter how to drive in a bright red Mercedes. She shoots forward in first gear, glances nervously at the father, bites her lip. But he has a solution to her powerlessness: a bottle of Coca-Cola. She shoots forward again, and it falls off the dashboard – but he catches it! Because he is a man! And, once she has drunk the Coca-Coca, she makes it into second gear, and the freedom of the road. She even remembers to take the handbrake off, but I’m not sure she checked her mirrors. What a metaphor! My first question about this ludicrous advert, which cynically exploits the crimes of this absolute monarchy against its subjects, is: is it a series? Will there be a new Coca-Cola advert every time a change occurs? Will the thief who formerly would have lost his hand be, instead, slapped on the back and given a bottle of Coca-Cola? Will the enslaved foreign maid be given her passport, her wages, and a bottle of Coca-Cola? Will the gay man have his sentence of death cancelled, and be given a rainbow flag and a bottle of Coca-Cola? If the execution of Princess Mishaal bint Fahd for adultery in 1977 were performed today, as an advert for Coca-Cola, would the blindfold be torn from her eyes as she is raised from her knees in a car-park – they executed her in a carpark, they love cars - and given an ice-cold bottle of Coca-Cola? Would the bottle have a limited edition princess theme because she’s worth it? What larks! Coca-Cola’s marketing department could, now I think of it, work in tandem with the Ministry of Justice, planning a campaign for every tweak in the kingdom’s shocking laws. Or maybe Saudi Arabia could, eventually, become a division of the Coca-Cola Company? Anything is possible. Capitalism has long promised freedom to its children. The “free market” is possibly the most influential advertising soundbite in the history of the world and it is free, if you can afford it.But Coca-Cola has done nothing for Saudi women except patronise them and attempt to sell carbonated drinks on the backs of their misery. This is tasteless, even from a company that once hinted it could usher in world peace with the 1971 “I’d like to buy the world a Coke” advert, in which people of multiple ethnicity sang a song on a hill-top, and drank some Coca-Cola, before going home to watch the latest news about the war in Vietnam. This is ambulance chasing, not social change. I’m switching to Pepsi.Women
