Coca-Cola said the "Message on a Bottle" programme will help consumers feel more connected while away from home.To take part in the programme, guests at Sheraton hotels in the US can speak to their concierge, while consumers can send a bottle to any Sheraton hotel room by visiting www.cokestore.com/sheraton. The message can be up to 18 characters long and will be printed on an 8oz glass bottle of Coca-Cola."As a brand, we are committed to going above and beyond for our guests to make them comfortable and at home," said a spokesperson for Coca-Cola. "We feel this exciting programme allows us to do something extra special for business travellers this holiday season."The programme is a continuation of Coca-Cola's successful Share-a-Coke campaign which saw surnames, lyrics and emojis printed on special-edition Coke cans and bottles.Unicer rebrands as Super Bock Group
