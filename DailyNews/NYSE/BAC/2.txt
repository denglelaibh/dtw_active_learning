Menu Breaking news sponsored byShares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are now higher by more than 25% year-to-date and looking strong. Helped by a spike in interest rates — as a result of a marginally more hawkish Federal Reserve and other G4 central banks — BAC stock has staged a technically sound breakout that could move higher.Like I always say in this here column, without the proper perspective on the markets any given trader or investor over time will likely stand to give back a large chunk of his or her gains.As such, the current shift in central bank posturing is crucial for investors and trades focusing on banking and other financial stocks. Over the past days, weeks and even months we have heard from a multitude of important central banks that they are slowly shifting to a more hawkish tone, if only moderately so.On the multi-year weekly chart, we see that BAC stock (top part of the chart) dropped sharply along with the rest of financial companies and indeed the broader market during the 2008/2009 financial crisis.After years of “basing,” BofA blasted higher following the U.S. election, and by so doing scored a technical breakout. Upside momentum however quickly again began to wane and the stock didn’t do much for bullish investors from early March until this past September.After a prolonged period of rest BAC stock in September finally took the next leg higher, which now looks to have further upside.

In other words, BAC stock could be in for a period of not only absolute but also relative strength in the broader picture.

While the stock remains in this near-term resting period, odds look favorable that ultimately a continuation-move higher sets in toward year-end.Active investors and traders could look to buy BAC around current levels in the mid to high $27s for a next upside target at $29, followed by possibly $30 — although I do not expect this move to take place in a straight line.Check out Anthony Mirhaydari’s Daily Market Outlook for Nov. 3.Tell us what you think about this article!
