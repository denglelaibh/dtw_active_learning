Menu Breaking news sponsored byI have a special penchant for cryptocurrencies. In my view, the blockchain represents the future of business and financial transactions. In comparison, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is anachronistic. Despite its telecommunication edge, T stock has a reputation for being a “legacy investment.”Although I’m increasingly shifting my attention away from the traditional markets and towards cryptocurrencies, I consider T a relevant investment. Whether or not T stock works for you is entirely dependent on your personal needs and expectations.As my InvestorPlace colleague Dana Blankenhorn correctly stated, if you’re young and need a portfolio boost, look elsewhere. But as a steady income generating machine, T represents the mythical cash cow.Even if you’re young, that doesn’t mean you have to jump blindly into Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) or Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). These are great companies, and I’ve written positively about both of them. But sometimes, stability is its own reward.I learned this lesson not too long ago. After the proposed SegWit2x Bitcoin hardfork failed, the offshoot cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash jumped higher, taking down the original. In literally hours, I lost an ungodly amount of money. Fortunately, the digital markets stabilized, restoring my account balance.Usually, though, volatile events don’t end up with a happy ending. Humans are humans, and we panic. Thankfully, the T stock price is largely predictable. It moves higher modestly, but it’s not prone to dramatic losses.Of course, this year happens to be the time when the T stock price doesn’t fall in line with statistics. Year-to-date, T shares are down 20.5%. Is it time to cut your losses, or can something be salvaged?I have to admit that I’m in an awkward situation. A few months back, investment performance-aggregator TipRanks called me a “top blogger.” As luck would have it, they focused on my bullish sentiment towards the T stock price.At the time, I issued a caveat. AT&T is a buy, but its nearer-term technical action is ugly. However, I also said that it could be primed for a big leg up, based on both the technicals and the fundamentals.Unfortunately, the T stock price didn’t hold the $35 support line that I was banking on. Instead, after multiple bear attacks, shares crumbled late last month.In the ensuing days, T stock meandered between $33 and $34.50. Currently, shares are attempting to close the gap to get back above $35, to disappointing results.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/t-stock-beating-fight/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
