(9)AT&T Inc. was formerly known as SBC Communications Inc.In connection with the OpCo and AT&T Exchange Offers, AT&T is also soliciting consents (the "Consent Solicitations") from holders of the OpCo Notes to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the indentures governing the OpCo Notes (the "OpCo Indentures"). As of the Early Participation Date, the necessary consents to adopt the proposed amendments to the relevant OpCo Indentures with respect to each of the following OpCo Notes were obtained: (i) 7.120% Debentures, due July 15, 2097 of BellSouth, LLC, (ii) 5.950% Debentures due January 15, 2038 of Ameritech Capital Funding Corporation, (iii) 6.550% Notes due 2034 of BellSouth, LLC, (iv) 8.250% Senior Notes due November 15, 2031 of AT&T Corp., (v) 6.875% Notes due 2031 of BellSouth, LLC, (vi) 7.875% Debentures due 2030 of BellSouth, LLC, (vii) 6.550% Debentures due January 15, 2028 of Ameritech Capital Funding Corporation, (viii) 7.300% Debentures due August 15, 2026 of Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Incorporated and (ix) 7.125% Debentures due March 15, 2026 of Pacific Bell Telephone Company. AT&T has decided to waive the Requisite Consent condition (as defined in the OpCo and AT&T Offering Memorandum (as defined below)) with respect to all series of OpCo Notes other than the 6.040% Debentures, due November 15, 2026. As a result, the proposed amendments will become effective on the settlement date with respect to any series of OpCo Notes for which the necessary consents are received. If the proposed amendments to the OpCo Indentures are adopted, all OpCo Notes not tendered or not accepted for exchange will be governed by amended indentures, which will have less restrictive terms and afford reduced protections to the holders of those securities compared to those currently in the OpCo Indentures.  No accrued but unpaid interest will be paid on any OpCo Notes in connection with the Obligor Exchange Offer. However, interest on the applicable New AT&T Obligor Note will accrue from and include the most recent interest payment date of the tendered OpCo Note.The OpCo and AT&T Exchange Offers are being conducted upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an offering memorandum (the "OpCo and AT&T Offering Memorandum" and, together with the Maturity Extension Offering Memorandum, the "Offering Memoranda"), dated October 30, 2017, as amended by AT&T's press release, dated as of November 13, 2017, and the related letter of transmittal and consent (the "OpCo and AT&T Letter of Transmittal" and, together with the Maturity Extension Letter of Transmittal, the "Letters of Transmittal").The amount of outstanding Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Participation Date, as reflected in the tables above, satisfied the minimum tender condition in the New 2046 Exchange Offer.TERMS OF THE EXCHANGE OFFERSThe Maturity Extension Exchange Offers and the OpCo and AT&T Exchange Offers (collectively, the "Exchange Offers") are only made, and the New Notes are only being offered and will only be issued, and copies of the offering documents will only be made available, to a holder of Old Notes who has certified its status as either (a) a "qualified institutional buyer" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or (b) (i) a person who is not a "U.S. person" as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act, or a dealer or other professional fiduciary organized, incorporated or (if an individual) residing in the United States holding a discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) for the benefit or account of a non-"U.S. person", (ii) if located or resident in any Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented Directive 2003/71/EC, as amended, including by Directive 2010/73/EU (the "Prospectus Directive"), a "qualified investor" as defined in the Prospectus Directive and (iii) if located or resident in Canada, is located or resident in a province of Canada and is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in National Instrument 45-106 – Prospectus Exemptions ("NI 45-106"), and, if resident in Ontario, section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), in each case, that is not an individual unless that person is also a "permitted client" as defined in National Instrument 31-103 - Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations ("NI 31-103") (each, an "Eligible Holder").The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on November 28, 2017, unless extended or earlier terminated by AT&T.
