Many of those stocks slumped on Wednesday as markets become more optimistic about the prospects for U.S. tax reform, with the FANG quartet alone losing $60 billion in market capitalization.The enactment of a tax overhaul bill is more likely to shift which types of stocks outperform more than the overall trajectory of the bull market, he argues. While Quigg sees tax reform giving mid-single-digit upside to the S&P 500 Index, he notes that because most investors have relatively high allocations to equities at present they may be less willing to boost their U.S. stock holdings.Growth stocks have outperformed their value peers by roughly 15 percentage points in 2017 and by 55 percentage points during this bull market."For managers overweight growth/momentum, taking a defensive approach to tax reform appears prudent," writes Quigg.The strategist highlighted a handful of stocks that have hedge-fund ownership in excess of 5 percent and have been outperforming the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index by at least 50 percent this year to isolate the names most at risk of a violent rotation from growth to value. The list includes FANG components Facebook Inc. and Netflix Inc.
