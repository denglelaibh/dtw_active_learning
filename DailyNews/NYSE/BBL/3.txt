    This is the Elliott Associates we have been cultivated to expect.Phase two of Paul Singer's attempt to fabricate a place on BHP Billiton's board demonstrates the agile timing, the strategic flexibility and the personal toxicity that is the mark of the great agitator's campaigns past.Having been dismissed with private patience and the very public prejudice, Elliott Associates has returned the fray with a new and much less rigid plan to release $US46 billion in latent value from Australia's very recently recovered, big thinking, national mining icon.The new Elliott plan arrives at the same destination by a very different set of paths to the one proposed six weeks ago. And it arrives, too, with claims that BHP management has been misleading and deceptive in its public rejection of Elliott's original pitch and with allegations that tax avoidance is  the singular motivation for BHP's creation of a marketing hub in Singapore.While Elliott's flip-flop on the pathway to value creation was greeted with muted derision by BHP, the colourful sledging was not. The confrontation has taken a far more hostile hue and the expectation is that the tone of the Elliott pitch will drift darker and more personal yet.Elliott's Plan B opens with a recommendation that BHP's routinely contentious dual-listed structure would be collapsed into an Australian domicile structure, rather than into a British company. And what was a firm mechanic that would ensure excess capital would be returned to shareholders has now become a mere "yardstick" by which alternative investment options should be tested.And while Elliott continues to insist that BHP should get itself out of the petroleum business, the activist small shareholder is now essentially agnostic about how that might happen.Elliott's original offering was that BHP should demerge its North American shale and Gulf of Mexico offshore assets into a US listing, while the legacy Australian oil and gas assets would stay where they were.But now there are loads of options that should be considered to remove what Elliott represents, pretty appropriately when it comes to the shale business, as millstone on the progress BHP needs to make to match the long-term total shareholder returns of competitors and similar-sized entities operating in other industries."There are a number of obvious possible solutions to unlock the latent value of BHP's petroleum business, including a sale or demerger of the US petroleum business and a sale or ASX listing for the Australian and other remaining petroleum assets," the suddenly open-minded Elliott Associates claims in its latest exceptionally feisty presentation."Our preferred approach is a full or partial demerger of the petroleum business, in pursuit of the kind of significant value re-rating achieved by a successfully demerged South32," Elliott pitched."As an immediate first step, we call on management and the board to initiate an in-depth, open and truly independent review of BHP's petroleum business, to be overseen by a committee which includes management, shareholder representatives and outside experts, with full disclosure of all results on a timely basis."Apparently Elliott people stand ready to represent the interests of shareholders on any committee that BHP's board might see fit to set up.That is especially kind of them given that, according to the public record, Elliott is barely a shareholder of BHP at all. According to the latest 13F filings in the US, Elliott's observable shareholder in BHP sits at 2 million BHP Billiton plc ADRs. Each of them is worth 2 plc shares, so Elliott speaks for 4 million shares out of the 5.3 billion that BHP has on issue.So Elliott owns .008 per cent of BHP. Whatever else of BHP that Elliott might call its own has to be held in swaps and derivatives. But, from what we understand, BHP has been unable to reveal any other economic interest.Now, the only precedent I can recall of an individual shareholder working to recast BHP's portfolio and its strategy occurred back in 1986. The shareholder was Robert Holmes a Court and he eventually ended up sitting on BHP's board and becoming a force for clarity and progress. But he secured that board seat by owning 20 per cent of the business.Precedent would suggest, then, that Elliott is a multiple of 250 shy of shaping relevance here. And just claiming, without detail, an "extremely broad and deep rooted support" from a "significant quorum" of shareholders who own "tens of billions of US$" of BHP shares, well, that is just not going to crack it.So where should we expect this to go from here?Well, having eye-balled chief executive Andrew Mackenzie at Bank America Merrill Lynch's annual gathering of resource industry chiefs, we expect Elliott will ramp up the  invective with the most likely opportunity coming with confirmation of a new chairman and of the departure date for incumbent Jac Nasser.BHP's $US20 billion punt on US shale sits the fulcrum of the Elliott's case for value destruction through flawed acquisitions and that deal was done under Nasser's watch. Elliott assesses that BHP has invested $US29 billion in acquiring, attempting to grow and then sustain its US shale business. Elliott puts a value of $US6.5 billion on the business that has been created.More broadly Elliott claims that BHP has invested $US8 billion for zero return in oil and gas exploration through its dual-listed years. BHP's junior shareholder also asserts that BHP management has failed to make the case that petroleum generates counter-cyclical cash flows and that its claim for operational synergies between big mining and big oil are "weak and unconvincing".That BHP paid too much for shale and then assumed too much capital risk in the roll out of its growth strategy is an uncomfortable and unavoidable truth. And it is a truth now acknowledged by Mackenzie, whose technical authority and advice was important in management's decision to back the shale story.But that acceptance of a truth inconvenient does not mean that the BHP board should surrender its long manicured boardroom processes and management prerogative to external committee.That is not going to happen. And neither is this current board or management of a mind to collapse the DLC even into an Australian shell. It just costs too much. Not quite the $US1.3 billion that the UK option would have cost. But at maybe $US1 billion, the price for doing something that doesn't matter much seems high.Elliott has made this second pitch in full knowledge that it will be rejected for a third time. But earning a welcome from BHP is not the point here. As we have said from the get go, the only way Elliott can win anything here is to develop gravitation pull strong enough to lure other shareholders into its orbit of discontent.There is every expectation at BHP that Elliott will attempt either to get itself voted on to the the BHP board or attempt to put the Big Thinking Australian through the humiliation of a full board spill at either an EGM or an AGM.And, as Mackenzie demonstrated on Tuesday in Barcelona, BHP's best defence continues to be illumination of its now very apparent intent in shale and intimate demonstration of its unique growth narrative. Mackenzie has staked his legacy on portfolio refinement, intricate cost management and productivity growth.In Barcelona he foreshadowed to an audience that included Team Elliott another year of cost cutting that would support a 10 per cent value-uplift in 2018 while defining a growth story that would double BHP return on capital from 9.2 per cent.Mackenzie predicted the imminent addition of production equivalent of 1.8 million tonnes of cooper annually through the introduction of latent capacity. BHP will grow its output by 20 per cent at a cost of $US5 billion and the average internal rate of return will be 75 per cent. The ambition is to lift iron ore production to 290mtpa by 2019, to lift Olympic Dam copper production to 280,000 tonnes by 2022, and introduce new tonnes from its major Queensland coking coal hubs of Goonyella and Blackwater.Mackenzie indicated that the board would be asked to consider before the end of the year a $UD2.2 billion investment in doubling the size of the Spence copper mine in Chile. The 200,000 tonnes a year growth project is slated to hit the market by 2020, when BHP believes the copper market will enter structural deficit.
