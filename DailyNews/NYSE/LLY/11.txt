The cuts will save an estimated $500 million annually beginning next year. Lilly plans to invest half of the $500 million in projected savings into research and development for new medicines to treat a variety of conditions.Lilly will continue to determine where it needs to cut costs and improve efficiencies, Taylor said. Remaining cuts will come from workforce reductions, site closures and the consolidation of some responsibilities to existing shared service centers.More business news: ► Carrier postpones layoffs that were set to hit 3 days before Christmas► Indiana politicians got thousands in gifts while pushing solar policy► Anthem picks former UnitedHealth executive to become CEOAndrew Clark is an IndyStar digital producer.
