Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares are up more than 11.48% this year and recently increased 1.00% or $0.36 to settle at $36.21. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), on the other hand, is up 53.02% year to date as of 11/28/2017. It currently trades at $95.82 and has returned 1.20% during the past week.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are the two most active stocks in the Drug Manufacturers – Major industry based on today’s trading volumes. The market is clearly enthusiastic about both these stocks, but which is the better investment? To answer this, we will compare the two companies based on the strength of their growth, profitability, risk, returns, valuation, analyst recommendations, and insider trends.GrowthThe ability to consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate is a defining characteristic of the best companies for long-term investment. Analysts expect PFE to grow earnings at a 6.01% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, ABBV is expected to grow at a 15.71% annual rate. All else equal, ABBV’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.

Profitability and ReturnsA high growth rate isn’t necessarily valuable to investors. In fact, companies that overinvest in low return projects just to achieve a high growth rate can actually destroy shareholder value. Profitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. We’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) to measure this., compared to an EBITDA margin of 40.46% for AbbVie Inc. (ABBV). PFE’s ROI is 7.80% while ABBV has a ROI of 18.00%. The interpretation is that ABBV’s business generates a higher return on investment than PFE’s.Cash Flow 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Earnings don’t always accurately reflect the amount of cash that a company brings in. PFE’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.42. Comparatively, ABBV’s free cash flow per share was +1.32. On a percent-of-sales basis, PFE’s free cash flow was 4.74% while ABBV converted 8.22% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, ABBV is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskLiquidity and leverage ratios are important because they reveal the financial health of a company. PFE has a current ratio of 1.40 compared to 1.50 for ABBV. This means that ABBV can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. PFE’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.72 versus a D/E of 5.65 for ABBV. ABBV is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationPFE trades at a forward P/E of 13.17, a P/B of 3.55, and a P/S of 4.11, compared to a forward P/E of 14.63, a P/B of 22.87, and a P/S of 5.61 for ABBV. PFE is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsA cheap stock isn’t a good investment if the stock is priced accurately. To get a sense of “value” we must compare the current price to some measure of intrinsic value such as a price target. PFE is currently priced at a -4.96% to its one-year price target of 38.10. Comparatively, ABBV is -2.17% relative to its price target of 97.95. This suggests that PFE is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.60 for PFE and 2.30 for ABBV, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for PFE.Risk and VolatilityAnalyst use beta to measure a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Stocks with a beta above 1 tend to have bigger swings in price than the market as a whole, the opposite being the case for stocks with a beta below 1. PFE has a beta of 0.99 and ABBV’s beta is 1.52. PFE’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentAnalysts often look at short interest, or the percentage of a company’s float currently being shorted by investors, to aid in their outlook for a particular stock. PFE has a short ratio of 3.20 compared to a short interest of 1.87 for ABBV. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for ABBV.SummaryAbbVie Inc.
