General Electric recently announced its second dividend cut within 10 years causing the stock price to reach 52-week lows. Is it the right time to consider the stock?I explore what analysts are estimating for the next few years as well as how the market is currently pricing the stock.Using several valuation models, I find that General Electricâ€™s stock price is fairly valued and provide my average fair value estimate of $17.09.

It has not been pretty for General Electric (GE) shareholders. What should have been reason to rejoice according to many on June 12th when it was announced that CEO Jeff Immelt was stepping down and was being replaced by John Flannery, GE's stock price rose quickly but has since lost 37.95% since that date. Management then presented its plan to make the company profitable again but at the same time announced the dividend was being reduced by 50%. Shares have lost 10.56% since that announcement. The company is focused on cash flow generation among all its segments. If that is the case, then the company future prospects should look brighter. With shares at depressed levels and trading near 52-week, are they trading at fair value? Time to take a look.First, let's take a look at some of the current valuation metrics. GE current price to earnings ratio is 22.3. YCharts reports that the 5-year average is 24.1 while Gurufocus.com shows that GE's 10-year median PE ratio is 17.5. The industry median is 23.1x while the market is 21.7x. These indicators provide a mixed bag of overvalued and undervalued possibilities. Based on the PE, it is not entirely clear where GE really sits.In one of Chuck Carnevale's articles, he uses the earnings yield to quickly determine the valuation of a stock. The earnings yield is calculated by taking the current earnings divided by the stock's current price. Chuck feels that any value below 6% means that the stock is overvalued. In the case of GE, the TTM EPS is $0.81 and the current price is $18.12. The earnings yield is 4.5% which suggests that GE is overvalued.The infographic below further shows that GE's PEG ratio is 1.9x which is considered poor value based on next year's expected growth and that its price to book ratio which is 2.1x is undervalued based on its assets when compared to the industrial conglomerates industry average. Furthermore, the P/FCF is -78.32 demonstrating a negative free cash flow. GE's EV/EBIT is 19.2x which greater than most of its peers such as Honeywell (HON) at 17.4x, Carlisle Companies Inc (CSL) at 15.0x and 3M (MMM) at 20.9x. Compared to its peers, GE appears overvalued in general.

The current consensus among the 19 analysts is to hold GE and that this rating was issued in October after being rated a buy since at least April 2017.Based on the above findings, GE appears mixed overall and possibly leaning to overvalued.The infographic below shows what analysts are predicting as GE's earnings per share over the next few years.



Source: SimplyWall.StGE's EPS came in at $1.49 in FY2016. Management has revised its EPS guidance for FY2017 downward to $1.04 to $1.12 from $1.60 to $1.70 at the end of FY2016. Its FY2018 EPS was also revised to $1.00 to $1.07. Analysts are estimating a FY2017 EPS of $1.07 (range of $1.01 to $1.10), FY2018 EPS of $1.05 (range of $0.94 to $1.40) and FY2019 EPS of $1.07 ($0.85 to $1.20). This represents year over year growth of -28.19%, -1.86%, and 1.90% respectively. It should be noted that GE is transitioning in FY2017 from industrial operating + Verticals EPS to continuing EPS or Adjusted EPS. This had the effect for example of adjusting the industrial operating + vertical EPS estimate of $1.05 to $1.10 in FY2017 to an adjusted EPS estimate of $1.04 to $1.12. The main reason for this change was to better align it with GE's peers. GE's future 5-year growth estimate is 8.67% which is well above its past 5-year growth rate of 2.40%. The company's future growth rate is below the industry's long-term growth rate estimate of 10.90%. This demonstrates that GE is slightly behind in its industry but not by much.If analyst's estimates are accurate, then GE is currently trading at 16.9x FY2017 earnings, 17.3x FY2018 earnings and 16.9x FY2019 earnings. These PE ratios are all below the 5-year average and the 10-year median which may present a tempting entry price for future earnings. If I use the 5-year PE ratio, based on GE's EPS estimates, the stock would be trading around $25.79 in FY2017, $25.31 in FY2018 and $25.79 in FY2019. This suggests that GE's current stock price could be undervalued by 42.32% if the stock were to be trading around $25.79. Investors are currently pessimistic about GE's turnaround prospects and wonder if enough has been to done to help the company recover long term. Many also believe that the turnaround will take years which is why it is so undervalued. On the other hand, it is unlikely that GE should be trading at a PE of 24.1 and that this 5-year average will have to be adjusted to reflect the future GE.Over the next 12 months, analysts are estimating that GE's median price estimate will be $22.00 which represents 21.6% upside from the current price. The range runs from a low of $17.00 (6% downside) to a high of $35.00 (93.5% upside). This shows that there is little downside risk to GE's share price (if estimates hold true) while the upside potential is much greater. This is a favorable risk/reward argument but there could be additional revisions to price estimates forthcoming that would reduce the upside potential.I used a reverse DCF to determine how much the market expects GE's growth rate to be. With shares trading at $18.12, the market is pricing in earnings to grow at 12.00%. This does not align at all with the current EPS outlook of the company. This could suggest further downside as the market attempts to value GE shares accordingly.What is my fair value estimate for GE? To answer this question, I calculated the fair value of GE using three models: Discounted Cash Flow, Graham's Formula, and EBIT multiples.The inputs I used for the DCF was a growth rate of 3.3%, a discount rate of 5.56% based on the work of Prof. Damodaren's rates for each industry, a terminal rate of 2% and a starting net income value of $8.83B. I used net income instead of DCF due to the negative free cash value and the inconsistency in free cash flows. These inputs provided a fair value estimate of $6.37.The inputs I used for the Graham's Formula include a growth rate of 0%, an EPS estimate of $1.07 and a 20-year AAA corporate bond rate of 3.60%. This provided a fair value estimate of $9.15. Please note that the Graham Formula is not the same as the Graham Number and that the formula has also been modified. The explanations of each can be found here and here respectively.The inputs I used for the EBIT model has a conservative, normal and aggressive case. Based on GE's past 5-year EV/EBIT history, I chose a multiple of 15.55x for the conservative case, 19.13x for the normal case and 23.67x for the aggressive case. Revenue estimates were $124.26 in each case. This resulted in fair value estimates of $16.73, $22.12 and $28.95 respectively.The table below provides a summary and calculations of the estimated fair value of GE.Current PriceDCFGrahamEBIT (Normal)Historical PEAnalysts EstimateAverage FVMedian FV$18.12$6.37$9.15$22.12$25.79$22.00$17.09$22.00Source: Old School ValueBased on these calculations, the average fair value estimate is $17.09 and the median fair value estimate is $22.00. Based on today's stock price, GE is currently overvalued by 5.68% or undervalued by 21.41%.Below you will find my risk/reward chart based on the long-term growth rate (8.67%) and the average and median fair value estimates. The red and green lines in the price action chart below represent the trading range of GE based on that growth rate. Obviously, when the stock is near the top line, it is not the time to buy and when it is near the bottom line, it is time to consider buying.

Source: Freestockcharts.com (weekly view)As you can see in the daily view chart, GE is in the buy price box. The gray box shows the median fair value as the upper buy limit. The 8.67% growth rate fit GE's price action very well on the top line since the great recession. Even the bottom line matched up with the drop during the same period. I did find that GE tends to find some support on the gray middle line and has in the past when the price action touched this line, the stock price rebounded. Now that GE finds itself below this marker, it may prove to be a point of resistance. This is within the $25.00 range. I would expect for the time being for GE to trade within the green and the gray lines until the company has proved the turnaround is working.Here is a quick table to show various margins of safety based on the estimated fair value.Average FV$17.09Median FV$22.00Margin of Safety5%$16.285%$20.9510%$15.5410%$20.0015%$14.8615%$19.1320%$14.2420%$18.3325%$13.6725%$17.60ConclusionGE has already begun its recovery from its lows caused by the investor presentation on November 13th. At the present time, GE appears to have found support around the $18.00 which could represent a firm floor. If you believe in management's ability to turn GE around, this may be an opportune time to invest in the company. Although I believe investment firms are still working on how to value GE at the moment, based on this analysis, there could be some upward potential and a favorable risk/reward profile. I would be inclined to follow suit with the analysts covering GE and would call GE a hold since there remains a lot of uncertainty. This analysis has showed that there are some aspects in which GE is under and overvalued which would corroborate the perceived uncertainty. I for one am not investing in GE because of the uncertain future of the company's dividend which I outlined in my previous article.I hope you enjoyed this article.
