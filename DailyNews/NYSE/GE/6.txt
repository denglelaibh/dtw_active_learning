      The complaint alleges that throughout the class period Defendants issued 
      materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose 
      that: (i) the Company's various operating segments, including its Power 
      segment, were underperforming Company projections, with order drops, 
      excess inventories and increased costs; (ii) in turn, the Company 
      overstated GE's full year 2017 guidance; and (iii) as a result of the 
      foregoing, General Electric’s public statements were materially false 
      and misleading at all relevant times.
    
If you suffered a loss in GE you have until January 
      2, 2018 to request that the Court appoint you as lead 
      plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that 
      you serve as a lead plaintiff.
