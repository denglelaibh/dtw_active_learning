Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that V may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for V is 60.96%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 59.91%, tells a similar story, and suggests that V currently trades in neutral territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Visa Inc. (V) average trading volume of 5,593,047 during the past month is 23.6% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?V is currently undervalued by -8.74% relative to the average 1-year price target of $122.70 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for V over the next year.How risky is the stock? Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has a beta of 0.98, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. V therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, V average daily volatility was 12.21%, which is -0.76 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.
