V – Visa’s market cap has fallen behind the total value of the world’s cryptocurrencies for the first time in history.Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is the world’s largest payments processor, but the value of the world of virtual currency — known as cryptocurrency — has actually surpassed Visa’s sizable market cap for the first time.Cryptocoins News has more details on this interesting development:The market valuation of all of the cryptocurrencies combined has surpassed the market cap of leading financial service provider Visa, by $30 billion.At the time of reporting, the market cap of Visa remains just above $254 billion, while the market valuation of the entire cryptocurrency market is $285.9 billion.According to the Visa 2016 annual report, the Visa network processes around $5.8 trillion worth of transactions per year, mostly from the 3.1 billion visa debit and credit card issued globally. More than 83.2 billion transactions were settled on the Visa network in 2016.Cryptocurrencies have a long way to go to catch up to Visa in that respect. The Ethereum network, for example, settles more transactions than the rest of the cryptocurrencies in the market combined, and the entire cryptocurrency market processes only around 1 million transactions per day. On aggregate, that’s around 30 million transactions per month, and approximately 360 million transactions per year.Thus, Visa’s total transactions processed is about 230 times that of the cryptocurrency world, so it’s safe to say Big V will be around for quite some time. And like many other payments processors, Visa is investing heavily in blockchain — the underlying technology that powers bitcoin and other cryptos — to ensure that it doesn’t get left behind.Visa Inc shares were trading at $112.31 per share on Monday morning, up $0.34 (+0.30%). Year-to-date, V has gained 44.97%, versus a 18.27% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.V currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 38 stocks in the Consumer Financial Services category.
