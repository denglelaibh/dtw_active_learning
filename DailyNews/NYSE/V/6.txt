Visa approved the program through Monaco’s issuer, Wirecard AG.“The demand for the Monaco Visa prepaid cards has exceeded our expectations with over 17,000 cards reserved, based on word of mouth alone,” Kris Marszalek, Monaco’s chief executive officer, said in a statement on Tuesday. “This is an important step towards Monaco’s vision to introduce cryptocurrency to the mass market.”Cryptocurrencies are clamoring for deals with Visa because it would mean they could be converted into fiat money and accepted at the 44 million merchant locations in the payments network. Monaco gained as much as 695 percent in value beginning on May 17, when the firm tweeted it would offer a Visa-branded payment card.
