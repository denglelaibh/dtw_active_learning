Meet the contendersThe company favored to win the race for airwaves appears to be Verizon (NYSE: VZ), who has taken on an "especially aggressive strategy" for taking over the spectrum. If approved by the FCC, two deals can bring in over 275 million new wireless customers and revenue streams.Verizon hopes to buy radio spectrum from Cox Communications, a $315 million investment that could return 28 million potential customers throughout Boston, New Orleans, Jacksonville (FL), Phoenix, San Diego, and Las Vegas.Â If the FCC approves the deal, it will help put Verizon well ahead of its competitors Sprint Nextel (NYSE: S) and AT&T (NYSE: T). Because the scarce spectrum space cannot be duplicated, Verizon could theoretically out-serve competitors in some regions.Verizon is also spending $3.6 billion (pending FCC approval) to obtain airwaves from SpectrumCo, which houses major cable companies including Comcast, Time Warner and Bright House Networks.Verizon's acquisition of the airwaves will be especially impacting to the industry now that AT&T has canceled its massive T-Mobile takeover. Had the deal gone through, AT&T would have overtaken Verizon as the industry leader.
