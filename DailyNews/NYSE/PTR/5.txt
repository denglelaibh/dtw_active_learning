Menu Breaking news sponsored byThe Chinese government sets gasoline prices at levels designed to provide reasonable profits for state-run oil companies. It gives military support if these companies drill in hotspots such as the South China Sea. And it helps seal deals, such as a recent $400 billion Sino-Russian natural gas contract.Investors in energy stocks often point to strong government support as reason enough to hold any or all of China’s oil giants through their listed stocks PetroChina Company Limited (ADR) (PTR), Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co. (ADR) (SHI) and CNOOC Ltd (ADR) (CEO).But the recent collapse in global crude oil prices, which the Chinese government can’t control, has punched a big hole in that reasoning. Investors now have a chance to take a hard look at Chinese energy stocks and may want to consider jumping ship before the hole gets bigger.The fact is, China’s Big Three oil companies are riskier than other global energy stocks right now. Energy stocks in general have been steadily sinking on the 50% plunge in crude prices since last summer. But over the past three months CNOOC shares have lost 27% in value, PetroChina stock has fallen 19% and Sinopec is down 15%. By comparison, BP plc (ADR) (BP)’s shares declined 18% and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) lost 7% during the same period.The Chinese companies stand out because they’re facing unique and potentially intense headwinds that can make other energy stocks look a lot safer. Here are five major risk factors:In recent days, Chinese stock analysts have been relatively quiet about the potential impact on the Big Three since crude prices plunged. One raising a red flag was Anxin Securities, which in a report commented, “In the context of plummeting oil prices, Sinopec and PetroChina’s profit margins narrowed significantly. The cost advantages of using LNG and CNG natural gas have declined, which is bad for the industry.”Huarong Securities offered an indirect warning: “We have stressed that the impact of the fall in crude oil prices on petroleum and petrochemical companies cannot be ignored… If you want to get involved again” in Chinese energy stocks “you may want to wait for a rebound in oil prices.”Considering the many risk factors, that seems like sound advice for investors in the big three Chinese oil stocks, PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2014/12/chinese-oil-stocks-risks/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
