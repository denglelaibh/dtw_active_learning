The bank’s Michael Cahill and Lorenzo Incoronato looked at the G10 group of most-traded currencies to test the belief that some display seasonal behavior."G10 FX markets are large, liquid and forward-looking, so at least in theory seasonal patterns should not persist," the analysts wrote in a note dated Nov. 28. "We test this idea using actual market return data and find that economic theory generally holds true: there is little evidence of seasonal patterns" on a monthly basis, they said.The latest focus has been the euro-Swedish krona cross-rate, where some market players "rationalize" recent krona weakness due to a seasonal pattern, Goldman said. Yet the study indicated that, given the large number of currency pairs to consider, "it is actually probable to see one of them go on this kind of ‘lucky streak’ from time to time."
