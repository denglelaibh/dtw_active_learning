It is expected to open in Alibaba’s home city, Hangzhou at the end of this month.The station will also have the company’s Hema supermarket like convenience store that allows customers to enter by scanning a QR code, select items and pay automatically through Alipay at the checkout.The concept is similar to Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Go stores where shoppers can enter by downloading the Amazon Go app and getting their smartphones scanned. They can pick up items and simply leave. After a while, money is charged online from their Amazon account.An updated version of the gas station is reportedly slated for launch next year. It will automatically identify the driver, car model and fuel type through artificial intelligence.Alibaba is also building a five-story shopping mall called More Mall in Hangzhou. The stock has gained 108.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 53.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.If the reports are true, the move will mark Alibaba’s renewed push into the petroleum space. In 2015, the company collaborated with China’s largest refiner China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec to launch an online industrial supply system. Alipay is in use at many gas stations across the country.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/alibaba-baba-looking-set-up-smart-gas-stations-ggsyn/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
