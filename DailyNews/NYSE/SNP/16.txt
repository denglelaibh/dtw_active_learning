BEIJING, Aug.Â 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Â China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation ("Sinopec" or the "Company")(HKEX: 386; SSE: 600028; NYSE: SNP) today announced its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2017.Financial Highlights:Business Highlights:In the first half of 2017, global economy recorded moderate recovery and Chinese economy maintained steady growth with gross domestic product (GDP) up by 6.9% year on year. With abundant supply, domestic refined oil products market witnessed strong competition. According to the statistics, domestic consumption of refined oil products increased by 5.5% compared with the first half of 2016, among which gasoline and kerosene consumption maintained strong growth momentum, and diesel consumption reversed its downward trend and realised growth year on year. Domestic demand for natural gas accelerated, up by 15.2% compared with the first half of 2016. Domestic consumption of major chemicals grow significantly with consumption of ethylene equivalent up by 10.5% year on year, and gross margin for chemical products remained strong.Mr. Wang Yupu, Chairman of Sinopec, said, "During the first half of 2017, we fully implemented value-oriented growth, innovation driven development, integrated resource allocation, openness to cooperation, and green, low-carbon development strategies and achieved solid operating results. Looking into the second half of 2017, we expect more reform measures to be announced by the Chinese government to revitalise real economy, the "Belt and Road" Initiative, synergetic development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Yangtze River Economic Belt development will be further implemented. The China's economy will maintain steady growth and drives the demand of refined oil products and petrochemical products as well as creates new growth opportunities for petroleum and petrochemical industry. The Company will continue to focus on supply-side structural reform, progressing with growth stabilisation, market expansion, cost reduction, structural adjustments, reform, and consolidating the basis as to deliver superior business results, providing larger value for our country, our shareholders, our staff, and our society."Business ReviewExploration and ProductionIn the first half of 2017, facing with low oil prices, the Company focused on reserve increase and development returns through our operation and production with superior results achieved. In exploration, our major direction maintained to focus on identification of high quality, large scale and low cost reserves. Number of new oil discoveries were made in Tahe Basin of Xinjiang, Junggar Basin, Shengli Oilfield and North Jiangsu Basin, and new natural gas discoveries were made in Sichuan Basin and Ordos Basin. In development, natural decline rate of natural fields was well controlled through refined development. Importance was attached to natural gas development, through expediting natural gas capacity construction in the Hangjinqi area of Erdos and fully promoting Phase II of Fuling Shale Gas development project. Production in the first half of 2017 was 221.38 million barrels of oil equivalent, up by 1.1% year on year, of which domestic crude production was 123.16 million barrels, overseas crude production was 22.82 million barrels, and total gas production was 452.12 billion cubic feet, increased 16.3% compared to the same period of last year.In the first half of 2017, operating revenues of the segment were RMB 74.1 billion, representing an increase of 41.1% year on year. This was mainly due to increased crude oil prices and expanded scale of LNG business. In the first half of 2017, the oil and gas lifting cost was RMB 767.3 per tonne, representing an increase of 3.2% year on year. In the first half of 2017, the segment applied low-cost development principle throughout its production and operation processes, and realized good results. Operating loss of this segment was RMB 18.3 billion in the first half of 2017, a decrease of RMB 3.6 billion compared with the same period of last year.Â  Exploration and Production: Summary of OperationsSix-month period ended 30 JuneChanges20172016(%)Oil and gas production (mmboe) 221.38218.991.1Crude oil production (mmbbls) 145.98154.17(5.3)China 123.16128.38(4.1)Overseas 22.8225.79(11.5)Natural gas production (bcf) 452.12388.6916.3Â RefiningIn the first half of 2017, our refined oil products mix has been optimized to address market demand changes, more high value-added products were produced and diesel-to-gasoline ratio further decreased to 1.15. We actively promoted refined oil products quality upgrading, and the GB VI quality upgrading plan for "2+26" cities in North China completed ahead of schedule. Crude oil sourcing optimisation continued to lower our feedstock cost, and export of refined oil products was increased moderately to help maintain high operational utilisation rates of refining facilities. The advantages of centralised marketing took full play, and profitability of asphalt, lubricant and LPG was maintained. In the first half of 2017, we processed 118 million tonnes of crude oil, increased by 1.6% compared to the same period of last year, and produced 74.11 million tonnes of refined oil products, with production of gasoline and kerosene up by 1.4% and 5.9% respectively, from levels in the first half of 2016.In the first half of 2017, operating revenues of the segment were RMB 488.2 billion, representing an increase of 23.0% year on year. This was mainly attributable to increased prices of products.In the first half of 2017, the refining margin (defined as sales revenues less crude oil and refining feedstock costs and taxes other than income tax, divided by the throughput of crude oil and refining feedstock) was RMB 473.7 per tonne, representing a decrease of 7.9% year on year. In the first of 2016, crude oil prices dropped below the lower threshold prescribed in the domestic refined oil product pricing mechanism for some period, and domestic refined oil prices were not cut during the corresponding period. In the first half of 2017, such phenomenon did not occur, as the result the prices spread between products and feedstock narrowed compared with the same period of 2017. The segment managed to improve its refining margin by advancing oil products quality upgrading and optimising product mix. In the first half of 2017, the segment realised an operating profit of RMB 29.4 billion, representing a decrease of RMB 3.2 billion year on year.Refining: Summary of OperationsSix-month period ended 30 JuneChanges20172016(%)Refinery throughput (million tonnes)117.79115.901.6Gasoline, diesel and kerosene production (million tonnes)74.1173.261.2Gasoline (million tonnes) 28.4128.031.4Diesel (million tonnes)32.6732.93(0.8)Kerosene (million tonnes)13.0312.305.9Light chemical feedstock production (million tonnes)18.9419.37(2.2)Note: Includes 100% of production of domestic joint ventures.Marketing and DistributionIn the first half of 2017, we took full advantages of our integrated business and distribution network to actively respond to over-supplied and competitive market conditions, and achieved good operational results.
