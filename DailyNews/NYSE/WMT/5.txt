(NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) are the two most active stocks in the Discount, Variety Stores industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investor interest in the two stocks is clearly very high, but which is the better investment? To answer this question, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, and valuation metrics, and also examine their analyst ratings and insider activity trends.GrowthOne of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect WMT to grow earnings at a 5.80% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, COST is expected to grow at a 9.51% annual rate. All else equal, COST’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.

Profitability and ReturnsGrowth isn’t very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 3.95% for Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST). WMT’s ROI is 13.40% while COST has a ROI of 16.00%. The interpretation is that COST’s business generates a higher return on investment than WMT’s.Cash Flow 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Earnings don’t always accurately reflect the amount of cash that a company brings in. WMT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.56. Comparatively, COST’s free cash flow per share was -5.56. On a percent-of-sales basis, WMT’s free cash flow was 0.34% while COST converted -1.88% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, WMT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskLiquidity and leverage ratios provide insight into the financial health of a company, and allow investors to determine the likelihood that the company will be able to continue operating as a going concern. WMT has a current ratio of 0.80 compared to 1.00 for COST. This means that COST can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. WMT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.62 versus a D/E of 0.62 for COST. WMT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationWMT trades at a forward P/E of 20.87, a P/B of 3.84, and a P/S of 0.59, compared to a forward P/E of 25.26, a P/B of 7.21, and a P/S of 0.60 for COST. WMT is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsWhen investing it’s crucial to distinguish between price and value. As Warren Buffet said, “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. WMT is currently priced at a -2.38% to its one-year price target of 99.94. Comparatively, COST is -0.74% relative to its price target of 178.85. This suggests that WMT is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40 for WMT and 2.10 for COST, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for WMT.Risk and VolatilityTo gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with a beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. WMT has a beta of 0.34 and COST’s beta is 0.94. WMT’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentThe analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level. Short interest, which represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted, captures what the market as a whole feels about a stock. WMT has a short ratio of 4.86 compared to a short interest of 4.62 for COST. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for COST.SummaryWal-Mart Stores, Inc.
