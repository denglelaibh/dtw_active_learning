Revenues increased 4.2% year over year to $123.2 billion and were ahead of the consensus mark of $121 billion.The company recorded the highest quarterly U.S. sales growth in nearly a decade driven by e-commerce surge and rising U.S. same-store sales.

U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 50%.The discount chain delighted investors with an upbeat outlook for the key holiday quarter. It expects U.S. same-store sales to grow 1.5-2%.
