Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that ABBV may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for ABBV is 56.45%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 73.74%, tells a different story, and suggests that ABBV currently trades in overbought territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) average trading volume of 6,109,405 during the past month is 1.02% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?ABBV is currently undervalued by -2.33% relative to the average 1-year price target of $95.83 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.30, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for ABBV over the next year.How risky is the stock? When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market.AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a beta of 1.52, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole.
