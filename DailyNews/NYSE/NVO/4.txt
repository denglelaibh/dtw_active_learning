The chief executive officer of Novo Nordisk A/S (ADR)(NYSE:NVO), Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, has warned that increasing cases of diabetes globally could overwhelm health systems and leave them unable to afford life-prolonging innovative drugs. Consequently Jorgensen has called for initiatives which will curb the rise of the disease. This has the potential of reducing demand for one of the signature products of Novo Nordisk, insulin. Currently Novo Nordisk is the leading maker of insulin in the world.According to Jorgensen unless the current trend is checked, approximately 736 million people will have contracted diabetes by the year 2045. With obesity being the number one cause of diabetes, Jorgensen, urged measures to be put in place in order to avoid an epidemic.“If we do not bend the curve the whole system will just be even more stressed and the ability to afford innovation is smaller,” said Jorgensen.Urban problemPer a report prepared a coalition of cities across the world the annual health expenditure related to diabetes will increase to over $1 trillion by the year 2045. Currently the figure is $775 billion and this would be a rise of close to 40%.
