Menu Breaking news sponsored byBoeing Co (NYSE:BA) is a good company, and has been one for many years. It makes good planes, and it pays a good dividend, one that has more than tripled over the last 10 years to $1.42 each quarter. It even increased that dividend during the Great Recession, so it’s durable. When looking for a market top, it helps to seek out excessive valuations on good companies. BA stock is overvalued.Boeing is the very definition of a good defensive holding. But BA stock is not trading at the price of a defensive holding. It’s trading at 24 times earnings, and has been absolutely on fire during 2017, rising over 68%.Compared to the rest of the market, this is not excessive. But Boeing offers evidence that the market is becoming a problem.As of this writing the average price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is 25.77, and the Shiller PE ratio, which tries to adjust for economic cycles and inflation, is at 31.53. This is a number exceeded only during the dot-com bubble, and higher than it was in 1929, before the stock market crash.The BA stock valuation is warning of trouble ahead.Since the 21st century began, PE ratios have jumped out of their previous boundaries, which usually ranged between 10-20 times earnings. They passed 40 during the dot-com bubble and rose to infinity during the Great Recession, when there were no earnings.As a result, many analysts no longer pay much attention to historic PEs. Critics say the Shiller ratio does not account for retained earnings, but even after making that adjustment the market is expensive.Again, Boeing is a fine company. But its results have not been special. The company is expecting $2.88 per share of earnings during the current quarter on $24.26 billion of revenue. Earnings would thus fall short of the September quarter, and yearly revenues would fall short of 2016’s $94.57 billion.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/ba-stock-bad-news/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
