The Boeing Co. and a nonprofit group called the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, or CASIS, have teamed up for the fourth year in a row to provide financial support for orbital entrepreneurship through the MassChallenge startup accelerator program.This year’s three winning projects will split $500,000 in grants for experiments designed to be done aboard the International Space Station in microgravity, popularly known as zero gravity.Final award of any grant money is contingent on acceptance of legal terms and conditions involving CASIS, Boeing and the grant recipients.CASIS is the organization in charge of managing the space station’s U.S. research program in its function as a national laboratory.Eleven startups in all have benefited from the “Technology in Space” prizes awarded since 2014 at MassChallenge Boston, with backing from CASIS and Boeing. The two startups selected for awards in 2015, Biorasis and LaunchPad Medical, should see their experiments fly to the space station next month aboard SpaceX’s Dragon cargo capsule.Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.GeekWire is once again proud to partner with Bank of America to support Geeks Give Back, a community-wide effort to raise more than $1 million for the Washington State Opportunity Scholarship.
