Menu Breaking news sponsored byBoeing Co (NYSE:BA) has been flying high in 2017, but a recent quarterly confessional points to the increased likelihood of some shareholder turbulence in BA stock. This is an excellent opportunity for prepared and creative investors using Boeing’s options market.Let me explain.No doubt readers have come across BA stock’s Q3 earnings report. As the proverbial “best in breed” constituent in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year with a less-than-doggish gain of nearly 70%, investors have more reasons than otherwise to sound off on why BA stock is a buy, sell or hold with each piece of new information.It’s this strategist’s opinion the latest report wasn’t the greatest or at least not the kind of fuel to suggest BA stock isn’t running on fumes at this point. Overall, the results look mixed when weighing items like Boeing’s modest beat, decent but not “wow-worthy” guidance and weaker-than-expected revenues in a couple of its key businesses.So, what’s next? Given BA stock has been flying high this year I don’t mind saying its likely time for shares to lose a bit of altitude, but potentially worth boarding at lower prices.The last time I wrote about BA stock in late September, I guesstimated shares could probably tack on an additional 4% to 6% before conditions were likely to become a bit technically heated and cloudier for bulls.At the recent highs, shares gained just over 4% to confirm our estimated upside potential.It’s time to be more defensive buying into the BA stock narrative. This is especially true when you consider its massive year-long rally that has failed to produce one meaningful correction and the fact that shares are establishing a weaker fourth-base pattern that has an increased likelihood of failure.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/boeing-co-ba-stock-is-still-a-buy/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
