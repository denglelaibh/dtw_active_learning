When we checked the annual dividend record of UPS we came to know that its High Dividend Yield is giving attention to Dividend Seeking Investors. Normally we know that only profitable companies pay out dividends. Newer companies are less likely to pay dividends because they don’t have a long record of profits and they are more likely to use their profits to pay for further growth of the company. Therefore, investors often view companies that have paid out significant dividends for an extended period of time as ‘safer’ investments. Thus, should events occur which may be detrimental to the share price, the allure of the dividend combined with the stability of the company can support the price somewhat. In my opinion, this stock can reward an investor a capital gain along with the very rich dividend.Let’s take an assessment at how United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) has been performing.

Using volume to analyze stocks can bolster profits and also reduce risk.Historically, a higher dividend yield has been considered to be desirable among many investors. A high dividend yield can be considered to be evidence that a stock is underpriced or that the company has fallen on hard times and future dividends will not be as high as previous ones. Similarly a low dividend yield can be considered evidence that the stock is overpriced or that future dividends might be higher. Some investors may find a higher dividend yield attractive, for instance as an aid to marketing a fund to retail investors, or maybe because they cannot get their hands on the capital, which may be tied up in a trust arrangement. In contrast some investors may find a higher dividend yield unattractive, perhaps because it increases their tax bill. I recommend readers use this list of stocks as a basis for further research. On its own the dividend yield tells you very little. It’s a raw figure that needs interpretation. Experienced investors use dividend yield in many ways when constructing their portfolio.Katy Gagnon has over 14 years experience in the stock industry giving her a vast understanding of how news affects the financial markets.
