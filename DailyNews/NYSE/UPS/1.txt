Not that most people will miss it.United Parcel Service Inc. last year began testing a program called Simplified Commercial Delivery, corporate speak for skipping the signature on office deliveries. Instead, its brown-clad legion of drivers speaks with someone at the business and enters the person’s name into their handheld devices.This fall it’s rolling out the program much more broadly, spokeswoman Peggy Gardner said. Gardner bills it as a win-win for everyone: UPS shaves a few seconds off each delivery, and people don’t have to drop their phones or step out of meetings to sign for packages.UPS stopped requiring signatures for most residential deliveries years ago, Gardner said. The company will still offer to collect signatures as a special service to businesses.
