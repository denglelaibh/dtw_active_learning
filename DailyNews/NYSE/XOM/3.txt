For this purpose, we have employed the free cash flow yield ratio. Companies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent to buy the stock.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for ExxonMobil stands at 4.4%, way higher than 1.9% for Chevron.Sufficient Funds to Meet Capital ExpenditureWe calculate a company’s free cash flow after deducting capital spending from operating cash flow. Over the last four quarters, free cash flow for ExxonMobil came in at $15.263 billion, indicating that the firm has sufficient cash flow to fund capital spending.
