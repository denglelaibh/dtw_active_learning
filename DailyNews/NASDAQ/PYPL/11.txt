PayPal's buyer protection was subject to a German court order.The court decided that German sellers can sue buyers, despite PayPal's buyer protection.Probably, this won't affect business in Germany.On the 22nd November, PayPal's stock (PYPL) was 1.03% down after a German court order against the company. As always, the big question is: What does the court ruling mean for the firm's business? Subject of the court order was PayPal's buyer protection, which enables customers to reclaim the money for a product which differs from the description or which never arrived. A seller filed a suit after a customer used the purchase protection and reclaimed the money for a smartphone which allegedly never arrived. According to the purchase agreement, the package was uninsured. After the seller couldn't give evidence for the delivery, PayPal transferred the money back to the customer. Now, the court order enables sellers to take legal action against buyers, despite PayPal's buyer protection. With regard to the case mentioned above, this means that the customer is not entitled to get the money back (as he is liable for the uninsured delivery, as agreed in the purchase agreement). I would say: Almost nothing. Let me explain why.First of all, the court order only applies for Germany. 35,3% of PayPal's net revenues come from other countries than the United States and UK. Thereof, Germany is only a small fraction.

For sellers, the court order is good news, since it provides legal protection against scammers. The ruling may even encourage traditionally rather cautious German businesses to enable payments via PayPal. Most of the customers won't be affected by PayPal's court order, as buyer protection cases are quite rare. Even if a buyer protection case arises, PayPal usually helps to mediate and to find a solution.For the seldom case that a seller is really upset with the outcome of the buyer protection, he still has to file a suit which is rather unlikely due to high expenses. I personally use PayPal as a seller (for an ecommerce business) and as a buyer - and I am completely convinced of the company's services. As a buyer, it is way easier than other payment providers. I also appreciate the buyer protection - even after the court order. Also for 34% of German citizens, PayPal is the most popular ecommerce payment provider. For my own ecommerce shop, I offer bank transfer, Stripe and PayPal as payment methods. The integration of PayPal noticeably increased our revenues. Our numbers also correspond to the survey mentioned above: around 30% of our payments are processed via PayPal. Summing it up, the court order may change some sentences in PayPal's terms and conditions for Germany, but I don't expect serious effects on the company's business.
