To determine if one is a better investment than the other, we will compare the two companies’ growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation characteristics, as well as their analyst ratings and sentiment signals.GrowthCompanies that can increase earnings at a high compound rate over time are attractive to investors. Analysts expect MNST to grow earnings at a 19.59% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, CCE is expected to grow at a 10.94% annual rate. All else equal, MNST’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.

Profitability and ReturnsA high growth rate isn’t necessarily valuable to investors. In fact, companies that overinvest in low return projects just to achieve a high growth rate can actually destroy shareholder value. Profitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. We’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) to measure this., compared to an EBITDA margin of 9.86% for Coca-Cola European Partners plc (CCE). MNST’s ROI is 21.60% while CCE has a ROI of 5.30%. The interpretation is that MNST’s business generates a higher return on investment than CCE’s.Cash Flow

If there’s one thing investors care more about than earnings, it’s cash flow. On a percent-of-sales basis, MNST’s free cash flow was 0% while CCE converted 0% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, MNST is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskAnalysts look at liquidity and leverage ratios to assess how easily a company can cover its liabilities. MNST has a current ratio of 3.20 compared to 1.00 for CCE. This means that MNST can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. MNST’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.00 versus a D/E of 0.89 for CCE. CCE is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationMNST trades at a forward P/E of 36.47, a P/B of 9.34, and a P/S of 10.20, compared to a forward P/E of 14.54, a P/B of 2.36, and a P/S of 1.47 for CCE. MNST is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsJust because a stock is cheaper doesn’t mean there’s more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where it’s likely to trade in the future. MNST is currently priced at a 0.86% to its one-year price target of 61.47. Comparatively, CCE is -13.41% relative to its price target of 44.53. This suggests that CCE is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.00 for MNST and 2.40 for CCE, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for CCE.Risk and VolatilityNo discussion on value is complete without taking into account risk. Analysts use a stock’s beta, which measures the volatility of a stock compared to the overall market, to measure systematic risk. A stock with a beta above 1 is more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies a below average level of risk. MNST has a beta of 0.93 and CCE’s beta is 0.95. MNST’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentShort interest is another tool that analysts use to gauge investor sentiment. It represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares that are being shorted. MNST has a short ratio of 2.55 compared to a short interest of 1.29 for CCE. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for CCE.SummaryMonster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) beats Coca-Cola European Partners plc (NYSE:CCE) on a total of 7 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. MNST is growing fastly, is more profitable, generates a higher return on investment, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. Finally, PEP has better sentiment signals based on short interest.var fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl,fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl_poll=function(){var r=0;return function(n,l){clearInterval(r),r=setInterval(n,l)}}();!function(e,t,n){if(e.getElementById(n)){fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl_poll(function(){if(window['om_loaded']){if(!fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl){fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl=new OptinMonsterApp();return fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl.init({"u":"7491.622174","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});}}},25);return;}var d=false,o=e.createElement(t);o.id=n,o.src="//a.optnmstr.com/app/js/api.min.js",o.async=true,o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=function(){if(!d){if(!this.readyState||this.readyState==="loaded"||this.readyState==="complete"){try{d=om_loaded=true;fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl=new OptinMonsterApp();fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl.init({"u":"7491.622174","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=null;}catch(t){}}}};(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.documentElement).appendChild(o)}(document,"script","omapi-script");
