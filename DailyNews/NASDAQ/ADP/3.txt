Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are up more than 33.54% this year and recently decreased -1.27% or -$1.07 to settle at $82.98. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), on the other hand, is up 7.67% year to date as of 11/15/2017. It currently trades at $110.66 and has returned -1.71% during the past week.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) are the two most active stocks in the Business Software & Services industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investor interest in the two stocks is clearly very high, but which is the better investment? To answer this question, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, and valuation metrics, and also examine their analyst ratings and insider activity trends.GrowthOne of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect MSFT to grow earnings at a 10.58% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, ADP is expected to grow at a 10.63% annual rate. All else equal, ADP’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.

Profitability and ReturnsJust, if not more, important than the growth rate is the quality of that growth. Growth can actual be harmful to investors if it comes at the cost of weak profitability and low returns. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 23.01% for Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). MSFT’s ROI is 11.70% while ADP has a ROI of 29.00%. The interpretation is that ADP’s business generates a higher return on investment than MSFT’s.Cash Flow

Cash is king when it comes to investing. MSFT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.94. Comparatively, ADP’s free cash flow per share was -0.18. On a percent-of-sales basis, MSFT’s free cash flow was 8.06% while ADP converted -0.64% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, MSFT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskBalance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. MSFT has a current ratio of 3.10 compared to 1.10 for ADP. This means that MSFT can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. MSFT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.95 versus a D/E of 0.51 for ADP. MSFT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationMSFT trades at a forward P/E of 22.02, a P/B of 7.13, and a P/S of 6.83, compared to a forward P/E of 25.65, a P/B of 12.38, and a P/S of 3.94 for ADP. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsA cheap stock is not necessarily a value stock. Most of the time, a stock is cheap for good reason. A stock only has value if the current price is substantially below the price at which it should trade in the future. MSFT is currently priced at a -8.49% to its one-year price target of 90.68. Comparatively, ADP is -1.02% relative to its price target of 111.80. This suggests that MSFT is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.90 for MSFT and 2.80 for ADP, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for ADP.Risk and VolatilityBeta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. MSFT has a beta of 1.00 and ADP’s beta is 0.90. ADP’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentComparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. MSFT has a short ratio of 2.78 compared to a short interest of 2.13 for ADP. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for ADP.SummaryMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) beats Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) on a total of 8 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. MSFT is more profitable, has higher cash flow per share, has a higher cash conversion rate and higher liquidity. In terms of valuation, MSFT is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings and book value, MSFT is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, OSTK has better sentiment signals based on short interest.var fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl,fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl_poll=function(){var r=0;return function(n,l){clearInterval(r),r=setInterval(n,l)}}();!function(e,t,n){if(e.getElementById(n)){fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl_poll(function(){if(window['om_loaded']){if(!fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl){fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl=new OptinMonsterApp();return fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl.init({"u":"7491.622174","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});}}},25);return;}var d=false,o=e.createElement(t);o.id=n,o.src="//a.optnmstr.com/app/js/api.min.js",o.async=true,o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=function(){if(!d){if(!this.readyState||this.readyState==="loaded"||this.readyState==="complete"){try{d=om_loaded=true;fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl=new OptinMonsterApp();fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl.init({"u":"7491.622174","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=null;}catch(t){}}}};(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.documentElement).appendChild(o)}(document,"script","omapi-script");
