												Bill Ackman is not happy with proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services.The hedgie behind Pershing Square said ISS relied on “non-public, inaccurate and misleading information, claims, and arguments” it received from Automatic Data Processing in its mostly pro-ADP recommendations on how shareholders should vote at the payroll processor’s meeting next week.ISS released a report last week in which it urged shareholders to support ADP’s slate of board candidates with the exception of Eric Fast. Withholding a vote for Fast would “provide an opening” for Ackman to be elected, ISS said.But the proxy advisory firm did not endorse Ackman’s two other nominees.Ackman wants ISS to issue a “corrective” report that also takes into account Ackman’s responses to non-public information ADP provided to ISS.With such information, ISS might come to a “materially more favorable conclusion for Pershing Square,” Ackman wrote.Ackman’s complaints were contained in an 18-page letter sent to ISS on Monday.Reps from ISS and ADP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
