Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) shares are up more than 2.71% this year and recently decreased -1.90% or -$1.99 to settle at $102.99. Ocera Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCRX), on the other hand, is down -18.57% year to date as of 11/08/2017. It currently trades at $1.71 and has returned -0.58% during the past week.Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) and Ocera Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCRX) are the two most active stocks in the Biotechnology industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investors are clearly interested in the two names, but is one a better choice than the other? We will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends to answer this question.Profitability and ReturnsA high growth rate isn’t necessarily valuable to investors. In fact, companies that overinvest in low return projects just to achieve a high growth rate can actually destroy shareholder value. Profitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. We’ll use Return on Investment (ROI) to measure this. INCY’s ROI is 13.20% while OCRX has a ROI of -101.90%. The interpretation is that INCY’s business generates a higher return on investment than OCRX’s.

Cash Flow Cash is king when it comes to investing. INCY’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.09. Comparatively, OCRX’s free cash flow per share was -0.17. On a percent-of-sales basis, INCY’s free cash flow was 1.72% while OCRX converted -0.74% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, INCY is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial Risk
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Liquidity and leverage ratios provide insight into the financial health of a company, and allow investors to determine the likelihood that the company will be able to continue operating as a going concern. INCY has a current ratio of 4.80 compared to 1.70 for OCRX. This means that INCY can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. INCY’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.01 versus a D/E of 0.92 for OCRX. OCRX is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationINCY trades at a forward P/E of 213.23, a P/B of 12.12, and a P/S of 15.53, compared to a P/B of 4.89, and a P/S of 76.89 for OCRX. INCY is the cheaper of the two stocks on sales basis but is expensive in terms of P/E and P/B ratio. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsJust because a stock is cheaper doesn’t mean there’s more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where it’s likely to trade in the future. INCY is currently priced at a -30.67% to its one-year price target of 148.56. Comparatively, OCRX is -77.2% relative to its price target of 7.50. This suggests that OCRX is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.90 for INCY and 2.00 for OCRX, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for OCRX.Risk and VolatilityAnalyst use beta to measure a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Stocks with a beta above 1 tend to have bigger swings in price than the market as a whole, the opposite being the case for stocks with a beta below 1. INCY has a beta of 0.82 and OCRX’s beta is 2.04. INCY’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentAnalysts often look at short interest, or the percentage of a company’s float currently being shorted by investors, to aid in their outlook for a particular stock. INCY has a short ratio of 3.20 compared to a short interest of 0.81 for OCRX. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for OCRX.SummaryIncyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) beats Ocera Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCRX) on a total of 8 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. INCY generates a higher return on investment, has higher cash flow per share, has a higher cash conversion rate, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. Finally, DVAX has better sentiment signals based on short interest.var fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl,fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl_poll=function(){var r=0;return function(n,l){clearInterval(r),r=setInterval(n,l)}}();!function(e,t,n){if(e.getElementById(n)){fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl_poll(function(){if(window['om_loaded']){if(!fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl){fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl=new OptinMonsterApp();return fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl.init({"u":"7491.622174","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});}}},25);return;}var d=false,o=e.createElement(t);o.id=n,o.src="//a.optnmstr.com/app/js/api.min.js",o.async=true,o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=function(){if(!d){if(!this.readyState||this.readyState==="loaded"||this.readyState==="complete"){try{d=om_loaded=true;fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl=new OptinMonsterApp();fcbrqpfh7khqsprd6mwl.init({"u":"7491.622174","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=null;}catch(t){}}}};(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.documentElement).appendChild(o)}(document,"script","omapi-script");
