As traders, we are more interested to take part in strong moves and don’t join moves that show weakness – or we may even watch for an entry in the opposite direction of a weak move. These guidelines do not hold true in all situations, but they are a good general aid in trading decisions.Currently, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading is at 49.98. RSI is a quick tool you can use to gauge overbought and oversold levels, the Relative Strength Index. The premise is simple, however. When RSI moves above 70, it is overbought and could lead to a downward move. When RSI moves below 30, it is oversold and could lead to an upward move. But, we must be patient before we enter our trades, because sometimes the RSI can stay overbought or oversold for quite awhile. The worst thing we can do is try to pick a top or a bottom of a strong move that continues to move into further overbought or oversold territory. So we must wait until the RSI crosses back under 70 or crosses back above 30.Katy Gagnon has over 14 years experience in the stock industry giving her a vast understanding of how news affects the financial markets.
