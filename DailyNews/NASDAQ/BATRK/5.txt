So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. Beta is used to measure the volatility of the stock.

It is the amount of uncertainty or risk about the magnitude of changes in a stock’s value. Higher volatility means that a stock’s price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesn’t change dramatically – instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time.
