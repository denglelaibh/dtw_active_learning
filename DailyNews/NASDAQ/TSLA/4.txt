TSLA – DHL just joined a growing list of companies plunking down a deposit for Tesla semi trucks.It appears that demand for the new Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) all-electric semi truck is growing rather quickly.Shipping giant DHL just became the latest major firm to place a deposit on multiple big rigs, ordering 10 trucks. The shipping giant will reportedly use the semis for shuttle routes and also test the trucks for longer runs. Electrek has more details:Tesla first started taking reservations with a $5,000 deposit per truck, but has changed the listed deposit price last week to $20,000 for a“base reservation” of the production version and the full $200,000 for the “Founders Series” truck.This change could mean that Tesla is receiving higher than expected demand for the vehicle and the company wants to prioritize more serious customers that are willing to put down more money upfront to secure a place in line.With this order from DHL, it brings our tally to just over 200 Tesla Semi trucks – give or take a few since some companies have not confirmed the number of trucks that they ordered.The big rig, which Tesla unveiled earlier this month, is claimed to have a 500 mile range and much faster acceleration than current diesel engines can offer. Delivery is slated for some time in 2019, although Tesla has a long history of missing deadlines.Tesla Inc shares rose $1.14 (+0.37%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 43.92%, versus a 19.20% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #16 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.
