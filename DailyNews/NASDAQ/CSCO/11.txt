Menu Breaking news sponsored byAs the internet has matured, so has Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). And along with that maturity, CSCO stock has continued to be a fairly appealing stock to some investors.The market leader in internet routers and switches has become a stable, albeit no-growth, stock. Sales have remained stable for years, at just short of $50 billion, and about 20% of it hits the net income line.Management has accepted this fate, and Cisco stock has been a reliable dividend payer since 2011, with its payout starting at 6-cents-per-share and rising to 29-cents-per-share and a yield of 3.2% at its Nov. 27 opening bid of about $36.50-per-share.CSCO stock may never regain its dot-com boom glory, where it briefly touched $80-per-share and Cisco was the world’s most valuable company, but those were different days. Today, Cisco counts victory in different ways.While old-line telecom suppliers like Lucent, Alcatel and Siemens have gone away, replaced by competitors like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Juniper Networks Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) and China’s Huawei Technologies, Cisco has kept strong, and now defines telecommunications in the internet age.The good news is this should continue to be the case. The latest quarterly market report from Synergy Research Group shows Cisco is maintaining its share of the market, which is the “lion’s share,” about 50%. In the third quarter this ticked up slightly, to 51%.This is no small feat for CSCO stock. The market was worth $11 billion in the last quarter, $44 billion in the last year, and it is continuing to grow, albeit at 3%-per-year. China resists American products, even those from Cisco, and cloud providers like do-it-yourself solutions. But Cisco continues to grow.In the largest market segment, which is Ethernet switching, and in the largest market, which is North America, Cisco is especially strong, with almost 60% of the market.Sticking to your knitting pays dividends.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/cisco-systems-inc-stock-is-a-safe-bet/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
