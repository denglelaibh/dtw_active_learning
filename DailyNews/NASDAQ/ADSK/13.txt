We’re experiencing healthy trends in several key transition metrics, including ARR and deferred revenue growth, as customers continue to embrace our new subscription offerings.  As we enter the growth phase of our model transition, we need to re-balance investments to focus on our strategic priorities. This includes divesting from some areas and increasing our investment in others.  We’re taking this restructuring action from a position of strength.  This is not a cost reduction activity as we maintain our commitment to keep total non-GAAP spend flat this year and next.Shares of Autodesk traded early Wednesday at $111.95, down almost 14%, with a consensus analyst price target of $133.57 and a 52-week range of $68.06 to $131.10.By Chris Lange
