AMAT Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report)	 as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for AMAT’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Longer Term Price Change for Applied MaterialsWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of AMAT, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 32.1% to 18%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 83.8%. Clearly, AMAT is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.Applied Materials, Inc. Price  Applied Materials, Inc. Price | Applied Materials, Inc. QuoteQuarter EPS Estimate Change for Applied Materials StockWhile looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn’t forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season, which is obviously vital for momentum investors.Right now, AMAT is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter’s earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates for Applied Materials have gone up by 6.9% compared to an industry average move of 0.9%, suggesting that not only is AMAT heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.AMAT Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with AMAT as of late.Over the past two months, eight earnings estimates have gone higher compared to one lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that five estimate has move upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, AMAT was expected to post earnings of $3.65 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $3.93 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have AMAT as a security with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.Visit performance for information about the performance numbers displayed above.Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.Real time prices by BATS.
