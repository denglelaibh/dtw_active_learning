Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) trades at $56.94 having a market capitalization of $60.98 billion. AMAT stock price climbed 78.61% over the past year, yielding a positive weighted alpha of 80.9 percent. Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope. Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha. Support is likely to come between $56.36 a share to $55.79 a share level. However, if the AMAT shares go below $55.79 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 2.02% decline from the most recent price.

And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.

(NASDAQ:KERX) shares can stay above the price resistance around $4.84 a share, that could help propel Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:KERX) higher to the next line of resistance at $4.93 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 7.33% volatility.
