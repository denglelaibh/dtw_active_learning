Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that CMCSA may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for CMCSA is 42.83%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 56.39%, tells a similar story, and suggests that CMCSA currently trades in neutral territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) average trading volume of 27,837,064 during the past month is 42.29% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?CMCSA is currently undervalued by -20.92% relative to the average 1-year price target of $45.31 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.60, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for CMCSA over the next year.How risky is the stock? Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk.Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has a beta of 1.01, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole.
