Revenue was $1.40 billion, up from $1.38 billion in last year's third period. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.27, which was shy of the $1.31 average estimate of 22 Wall Street analysts polled by Yahoo Finance."Fiserv continued to execute well, delivering double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth despite pressure from lower periodic revenue in the quarter," Jeffery Yabuki, president and chief executive of Fiserv, said in a statement. "Sales were solid in the quarter, providing momentum for a strong close to the year."
