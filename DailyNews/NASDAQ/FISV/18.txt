Fiserv Inc. has partnered with Sri Lanka's Commercial Bank of Ceylon on a project to replace the FI's current digital platform with an integrated digital banking solution.According to a press release, the bank will implement DigitalAccess from Fiserv, a readily deployable solution that provides a digital banking experience across smartphones, tablets and desktops.DigitalAccess will allow the bank to develop and deploy new banking capabilities and upgrades quickly and cost-effectively, improving speed to market while providing customers the flexibility and convenience they expect, the release said.The solution also will enable Combank to deliver digital banking services in local languages, Sinhala and Tamil for Sri Lanka, Bengali for Bangladesh, and Divehi for the Maldives.DigitalAccess, which integrates with the Fiserv Signature core account processing platform, allows customers to open bank accounts and apply for credit cards, loans and other banking products without having to visit a bank branch.Additional features include personal financial management tools, online mobile phone top-up capabilities, biometric authentication, actionable push notifications, and ATM and branch location searches."Consumer expectations of their financial services providers have never been higher, and this is increasingly true in mobile-first markets, where many consumers have leapfrogged over traditional financial service models to engage digitally," Marc Mathenz, Fiserv senior vice president and managing director for Asia Pacific, said in the release. "Commercial Bank of Ceylon is putting technology in place to allow them to update their digital banking services quickly, so they can be responsive to customer needs and stand out in a competitive market."Topics: ATM & Mobile Banking, Bank / Credit Union, SoftwareCompanies: FiservSponsored Links:The ATM world is in for a seismic shift ...
