(RTTNews) - Shares of easyJet Plc (ESYJY.PK, EZJ.L) and Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L) were gaining in the morning trading in London after domestic rival Monarch Airlines had been placed into administration. Monarch's all further flights from the UK had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled, accountants KPMG announced Monday.The Civil Aviation Authority said it had launched a program to bring 110,000 customers back home over the next fortnight, chartering 30 planes for the rescue operation.According to the regulator, all Monarch customers who are abroad and due to return to the UK in the next two weeks will be flown home at no extra cost. But the airline's 300,000 future bookings had been cancelled.The CAA chief executive, Andrew Haines, reportedly said, "We know that Monarch's decision to stop trading will be very distressing for all of its customers and employees. This is the biggest UK airline ever to cease trading, so the government has asked the CAA to support Monarch customers currently abroad to get back to the UK at the end of their holiday at no extra cost to them."Monarch was Britain's longest-surviving airline that offered scheduled, low-fare service. With a fleet of 30 Boeing and Airbus aircraft, the carrier served some 6.5 million passengers per year, primarily through agreements with tour operators.EasyJet shares were gaining around 3.53 percent to 1,260 pence.Ryanair shares were gaining 2.6 percent to 16.70 euros.
