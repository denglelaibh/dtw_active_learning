Menu Breaking news sponsored byAlthough the global economy has been booming as of late, the latest fiscal data in the U.S. suggests that the country is in dire straits, but this information has been skewered by the impact of the hurricanes that ravaged the southeastern U.S. The economy still managed to grow at a 3.1% rate in the third quarter, 0.1% ahead of the second quarter and topping the consensus estimate of 2.5%.Altice USA Inc (NYSE:ATUS), Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Sprint Corp (NYSE:S) all made headlines over the weekend over new agreements, a potential takeover and a failed merger.Altice USA has inked a deal with Sprint as the company seeks to keep more customers under its fold.Altice and Sprint, the fourth-largest cable operator and fourth-largest cable network in the U.S., have entered an agreement that will use Sprint’s network to offer voice and data services in the U.S.The carrier will benefit by using Altice’s cable infrastructure to roll out cellular data to the masses, while also developing 5G, the future of data services. The move comes only a day after Sprint’s proposed merger with T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) fell through for good.The move makes sense as Sprint still has some catching up to do with the other three top carriers as Sprint only has 54 million subscribers, below T-Mobile’s 70.7 million, AT&T Inc.’s (NYSE:T) 138.8 million and Verizon Wireless Communications Inc.’s (NYSE:VZ) 147.2 million, as of the carriers’ latest earnings calls.It is unclear what the timeline is regarding when the agreement will start benefiting consumers.ATUS shares have declined 30.9% year-to-date.Qualcomm is reportedly the subject of a potential takeover.Rival Broadcom Corporation is reportedly considering a $100 billion takeover bid — about $70 per share — to acquire Qualcomm, despite the latter not seeking to be bought out.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/stocks-watch-monday-altice-usa-inc-atus-qualcomm-inc-qcom-sprint-corp-s/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
