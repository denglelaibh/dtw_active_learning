In collaboration with the University of Michigan College of Engineering, the program's goal is to help close the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills gap. Officials expect the initiative to reach 1,500 Detroit-area high school students in its first year before expanding to reach 3,000 middle and high school students annually."Qualcomm is focused on building the wireless world of the future and wants to show students that they can be a part of inventing that future," Qualcomm Senior Vice President of Engineering Susan Armstrong said in an email.The San Diego-based telecommunications company invested $200,000, combined with other in-kind contributions, into the 6,200-square-foot center in the University of Michigan Detroit Center in Midtown. Michigan Engineering Zone designed the lab space based on San Diego's Thinkabit Lab.The lab will teach skills useful for developing wireless systems, smart cities, creative robotics and electronics, 5G and environmental monitoring, among other topics. It will host classes from local schools during the academic year and camp programs during the summer.Jeanne Pearl Murabito, executive director for student affairs at the UM engineering school and Michigan Engineering Zone co-founder, said there are more than 480,000 computing jobs available across the country, but just less than 43,000 graduates are in the pipeline."Qualcomm's Thinkabit Lab is designed to help close it by providing students with hands-on STEM learning beginning in grade school," Murabito said in an email. "Ensuring that young people are aware of career possibilities in STEM fields is a vital first step to building a robust future workforce."Get a roundup of important news that happens each day.
