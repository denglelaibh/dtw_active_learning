Comparatively, DIOD’s free cash flow per share was +0.06. On a percent-of-sales basis, XLNX’s free cash flow was 4.27% while DIOD converted 0% of its revenues into cash flow.

XLNX is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsA cheap stock isn’t a good investment if the stock is priced accurately.

Comparatively, DIOD is -9.66% relative to its price target of 34.67.

A beta above 1 implies above average market volatility. Conversely, a stock with a beta below 1 is seen as less risky than the overall market. XLNX has a beta of 1.10 and DIOD’s beta is 1.24. XLNX’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentThe analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level. Short interest, which represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted, captures what the market as a whole feels about a stock. XLNX has a short ratio of 4.20 compared to a short interest of 2.98 for DIOD. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for DIOD.SummaryDiodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD) beats Xilinx, Inc.
