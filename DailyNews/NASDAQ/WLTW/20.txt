Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. said Tuesday that it has recruited Mike Toner from Travelers Cos. Inc. and Scott Wallace from Marsh L.L.C. to take positions in its North America corporate risk and broking segment.Mr. Toner has been appointed corporate risk and broking market leader for New England, which includes offices in Boston and Billerica, Massachusetts; Hartford, Connecticut; Burlington, Vermont; and Buffalo, New York. Mr. Toner previously was chief sales officer for national accounts at Travelers. He is based in Boston and reports to Mark Rusas, Willis Towers Watson’s corporate risk and broking Northeast region leader. While this is not a new role, Mr. Toner will be the first corporate risk and brokering market leader for New England who will be located in Boston since the merger of Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. and Towers Watson & Co., which was completed in January 2016, according to a Willis Towers Watson spokeswoman.New England leadership was located outside of Boston at that time, but a company spokeswoman said that “we came to the conclusion that we needed boots on the ground leadership to make the most of our opportunities in Boston and demonstrate our commitment to that key market.” Mr. Wallace has been appointed corporate risk and broking market leader for Wisconsin, which includes offices in Brookfield and Appleton, Wisconsin. Based in Brookfield, Mr. Wallace came from Marsh, where he served as sales leader for its East Central partnership region. Mr. Wallace is replacing a former market leader, whose name Willis Towers Watson would not disclose, who left the company last spring, according to the spokeswoman. He will report to Mark Vila, CRB leader for greater Chicago and Wisconsin.   COPYRIGHT © 2017 BUSINESS INSURANCE HOLDINGS
