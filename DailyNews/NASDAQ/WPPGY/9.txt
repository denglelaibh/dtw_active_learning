Pound strength tends to weigh on shares of London-listed multinational companies with earnings in other currencies. “The pound is weakening against the euro with the strong [eurozone] manufacturing PMI prints,” said Henry Croft, research analyst at Accendo Markets. As well, it appears “the Brexit position from the U.K. government is softening a little bit and ... that might mean we’re not able to get some of the terms that had been set out by Theresa May in January, and she was pretty strong about that,” Croft said. “We could end up not getting the concessions the government wanted in the first place and it’s time to step back and re-evaluate the situation.” The pound

Shareholders and bond investors who were affected by the supermarket’s accounting scandal in 2014 were able on Wednesday to start making claims through Tesco’s multi-billion pound compensation scheme. Tesco said in 2014 it overstated its profit by £250 million. Investors who bought shares or bonds between Aug. 29 and through Sept. 19, 2014 are eligible.“Compensating investors is the final chapter in the accounting saga and Tesco is keen to put this episode behind them,” said Hargreaves Lansdown’s head of financial planning Danny Cox, in a note. “Stronger trading, particularly in the U.K., means that after a 2-plus year absence, Tesco is planning to restore its dividend this year.”  Brexit update: A slate of policy papers on Brexit was set to be published by the U.K. government on Wednesday. Reports suggested the government was backing away from a harder stance on the European Court of Justice’s say in U.K. law.
