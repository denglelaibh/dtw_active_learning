Menu Breaking news sponsored byThe semiconductor super-cycle is clearly underway. It resumed when prices for memory, processors, and NAND storage increased, driven by demand for a myriad of sectors. Even the PC chip giant, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), closed near yearly highs despite a slowing desktop and laptop market. Conversely, smartphone demand is growing at a faster pace. So if the potential in the mobile market, not computers, is high, will INTC stock break-out from the $45.75 recent price and close above $50 this year?Barclays thinks INTC stock will trade even higher than the $50s. It raised its price target by $10 and set it to $55. Intel may sell the most PC chips in the world but its business in the back-end server market is even more of a driver for growth. Mobile devices connect to the telecom network but that data it accesses is managed by powerful computers. As AI, big data consumption and complex data analytics develop, Intel will benefit.Intel just started the Purley ramp (now called the Xeon Scalable Processors with Intel C620 Series Chipsets). Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google will use this chip, as will Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). This comes after Intel reported 200 design wins. Tier 2 Cloud services providers and enterprises will use these chips. Though revenue may grow in the modest single digits at around 7%, that still adds to Intel’s profits.Intel benefits from the growth in the demand for memory. It has a partnership with Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) for 3D XPoint development. As demand for ever faster storage picks up, Intel’s profits will grow. INTC stock trades at a P/E of 16 times. But there is room for a multiples expansion. Samsung reported record profits and Micron raised its outlook. This suggests Intel should trade at higher multiples and would imply a share price of above $50.In the third quarter, Intel reported operating margins of 46 percent while gross margins will be 63 percent in Q4. ASPs (average selling prices) and per unit costs are falling. Intel also expects ramping up costs for 10-nanometer manufacturing will fall. Conversely, modem and memory costs and higher marketing expenses will limit the profit margin improvements.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/intc-stock-close-above/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
