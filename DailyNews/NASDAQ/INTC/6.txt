Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockWow. That’s the only word I can think of when I look at the chart of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). The INTC stock price is apparently targeting the moon, as it’s been a rocket over the past week.The INTC stock price is up 16.5% in the last five trading sessions and now more than 20% over the last month. Does Intel deserve a 30% year-to-date rally or the 40% gain since the beginning of July?Last week, earnings per share of $1.01 came in ~25% ahead of consensus estimates. Revenue results beat expectations too, although sales grew just 2.3% year-over-year. Full-year guidance was the real driver though, as management now expects earnings of $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion. Analysts were looking for $3.01 per share and $61.39 billion, respectively.The conference call was littered with positive commentary about higher-growth businesses. Reports that Intel might push out Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) for modem components in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices only fueled the positive sentiment. And while all this is great, is the rally really warranted?Analysts, with a new full-year consensus estimate of $62.02 billion in sales, expect revenue growth of 4.3% in 2017. Next year, estimates call for just 2.7% growth. On the earnings front, with one quarter to go, analysts expect 2017 earnings growth of 19.1%. Next year though, those estimates fall to about flat growth.But here’s the thing. Intel trades with a forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.5. That’s peanuts, really. While Intel isn’t growing earnings next year, growth should resume in 2019. As a kicker, INTC stock also pays a 2.4% dividend yield, despite its massive rally over the past few months.
Click to EnlargeAfter breaking out over $37, INTC stock has put the pedal to the metal. Now at $47, shares are extremely overbought (see chart above). In fact, I highlighted INTC, along with Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) as some of the most overbought stocks in the entire Dow Jones Industrial Average. In order to buy INTC, we need a pullback. Heck, we at least need INTC to consolidate.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/intel-massively-overbought-should-you-sell/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
