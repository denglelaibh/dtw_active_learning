Menu Breaking news sponsored byWithout a hint of hesitation, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of the top flyers of 2016. Producing a 300% annual return and leading the dynamic semiconductor market will do that for you. The question now is whether or not AMD stock has something left in the tank.Ardent AMD bulls hate the inquiry, but it’s something that has to be asked. Advanced Micro rival Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also had a stellar run in 2016.The pivotal difference, of course, is that Nvidia is still giving its competitors fits. Year-to-date, NVDA is up 98%. Short of a catastrophic event, Nvidia will again post a stellar year.But for the AMD stock price, a cloud of doubt hangs overhead. Currently, shares are barely above parity. In order to come close to having a great year (let alone something approaching its chief rival) a tremendously bullish catalyst must appear.Even Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is making a lot of noise, with its shares up 23% YTD.Naturally, many Advanced Micro supporters are unfazed: they saw this rodeo before in 2015 and look what happened the following year. The problem with that argument is that the stories that pushed the AMD stock price into the stratosphere are no longer fresh.In other words, everybody has seen AMD’s playbook.As far as I know, NFL teams constantly update their playbooks every season to maintain their competitive edge. And I do know that the markets don’t trade on old news; otherwise, what would drive people to risk incarceration for insider information?Still, the AMD stock price quadrupled over a two-year period, affirming its immense progress. But will its recent improvements be enough for a standout performance in 2018?Anyone who doubts Advanced Micro should take a quick look at its credentials. As InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli points out, AMD’s attention towards bang-for-the-buck performance bodes well for its Ryzen CPU and Radeon Vega graphics card.Especially with the latter, video gaming is serious business, so the Vega should do well for the company.Additionally, AMD stock is boosted by management’s aggressive push into the datacenter market. Although Intel dominates the sector, AMD “has snagged customers like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Dell, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Baidu Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU).”Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/amd-stock-find-grow/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
