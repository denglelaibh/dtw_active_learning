DISH DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report)	 is a leading satellite TV operator in the U.S. The company provides video services under the DISH brand. In addition, the company provides satellite broadband services, and wireline voice and broadband services.DISH Network’s top-line growth may remain under pressure as the company’s failure to strike any deal with wireless operators to deploy a nationwide wireless network has been a major headwind. Persistent loss of subscribers remains a potent headwind for DISH Network.  Escalating programming and content expenses as well as retransmission fees may also hurt the company’s margins.We are, however, impressed with DISH Network’s efforts to diversify its business model from being a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet TV operator. This should help the company counter competitive threats from low-cost video streaming operators. DISH Network is also looking for wireless opportunities. The company has created an extensive portfolio of wireless spectrum, valued at around $50 billion. Launch of a mobile app, DISH Music and Air TV Player bodes well.Zacks Rank: DISH Network currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.Visit performance for information about the performance numbers displayed above.Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.Real time prices by BATS.
