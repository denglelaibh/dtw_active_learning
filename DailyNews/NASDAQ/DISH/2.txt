The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.
 That is because DISH Network is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DISH in this report.
 In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 61 cents per share for DISH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DISH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.67% heading into earnings season.DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseDISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | DISH Network Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?
