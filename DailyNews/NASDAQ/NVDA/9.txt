Menu Breaking news sponsored byNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been on a huge rally recently. NVDA stock is up more than 15% over the past month and has solidly overtaken the $200 level.It seems like this is a growth stock that just can’t be stopped.But it pays to remember that every once and a while, earnings are a road bump in this growth story. Just look at the most recent earnings report. Despite big beats, NVDA stock dropped more than 5%. The same thing happened in February 2017, when a big earnings beat resulted in NVDA stock dropping.What do those two earnings reports have in common?NVDA stock had rallied big into both of those prints. But when NVDA doesn’t rally big into earnings, NVDA stock tends to jump big on solid numbers. See the May 2017 and November 2016 reports.Overall then, NVDA earnings are a “sell the news” event when the stock has rallied big into the report. They are a “buy the surprise” event when the stock has been flattish into the report.Where does NVDA find itself today?Well, the stock has rallied 33% since the last earnings report. That puts NVDA stock in the ballpark of where it was prior to the August 2017 and February 2017 reports. Prior to the August 2017 report, NVDA stock had run up 35% since the last earnings report. Prior to the February 2017 report, NVDA stock had run up 32% since the prior earnings report.After both the August and February 2017 reports, NVDA stock dropped.Consequently, it looks like NVDA earnings are a “sell the news” event this time around. I expect shares to drop in response to the quarterly numbers. My conviction in this is strengthened by looking at how Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock dropped after its strong quarterly report.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/exercise-caution-nvidia-nvda-stock-ahead-earnings/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
