Menu Breaking news sponsored byIt’s easy to forget now, but Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) was pretty much a dead stock for the first few years of this decade. The ATVI stock price flat-lined around $11 from mid-2009 to the beginning of 2013.ATVI stock traded for a low double-digit EPS multiple, as investors fretted about the coming decline of the key World of Warcraft franchise and its impact on sales and earnings growth.Fast-forward a few years, and the story appears very different. ATVI has risen 470% in five years. The stock trades at almost 29x 2017 EPS estimates.The video game sector is one of the hottest in the market and ATVI actually has been the weakest of the big three developers.  Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) is up 694% in five years and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (NASDAQ:TTWO) has gained a whopping 854%.But if you look closely, I’m not sure the story is quite as different as valuation would suggest. Activision’s purchase of King Digital has been a smashing success, admittedly. The company paid less than 9x EPS for the business backing out King’s cash on the books.But for the rest of Activision Blizzard, earnings growth remains a serious problem. WoW still is declining. Call of Duty may be showing its age.The optimism toward eSports is real, and so is the opportunity there. But this is a company now worth almost $50 billion. And eSports alone isn’t going to support that type of valuation.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/atvi-stock-low-growth/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
