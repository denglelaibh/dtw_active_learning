ROST  reported solid third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines topped estimates and improved year over year. Further, earnings came ahead of the company's projection despite the tough year-over-year comparisons, volatile retail environment and the impact of two major hurricanes during the quarter.       Ross Store posted earnings of 72 cents a share that surpassed its guidance range of 64-67 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents. Earnings also improved 16.1% from 62 cents reported in the prior-year period.  Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     Surprise      Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Ross Stores, Inc. Quote Total sales for the quarter rose 7.8% to $3,328.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,273 million, driven by 4% increase in comparable-store sales (comps). Comps also surpassed the company's expected rise of 1-2%. This can primarily be attributed to rise in traffic and increased average basket size.    Cost of sales increased 7.4% to $2,369.1 million and 30 basis points (bps), as a percentage of sales. The improvement was driven by a 25-bps rise in merchandise margin, as well as a 20-bps decline in both occupancy and buying costs. However, these were marred by higher freight and distribution expenses. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses contracted 35 bps due to leverage on comps gain and non-recurring costs incurred last year.    Operating margin expanded 60 bps to 13.3%, which was better than the company's expectation of 12.4% and 12.6%. This outperformance stemmed from improved merchandise margins and leverage on higher-than-planned sales.   Store Update    The company's expansion plan is on track with the inclusion of 10 new dd's DISCOUNTS stores and 30 Ross Stores in the fiscal third quarter. This marked the completion of its store opening target for fiscal 2017. The company had planned to open a total of 90 stores in fiscal 2017, comprising 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS outlets.    Ross Stores expects to close fiscal 2017 with a total of 1,408 Ross and 213 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.   Financials    Ross Stores ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,144.2 million, long-term debt of $396.8 million and total shareholders' equity of $2,858.5 million.    During the reported quarter, the company bought back 3.6 million shares for $219 million. Year to date, the company repurchased a total of 10.5 million shares for $649 million. Evidently, it remains on track to repurchase $875 million worth shares in fiscal 2017 under its two-year $1.75 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2017.

Guidance    Following the solid fiscal third quarter, the company raised its sales view for the fiscal fourth quarter.

However, the company retained its earnings per share guidance of 88-92 cents versus 77 cents in the prior-year quarter. The company anticipates the benefit from increased comps to be offset by the certain expense timing shift into the fiscal fourth quarter this year.    In addition, the company expects sales growth of 11-12% in the fiscal fourth quarter, including a benefit from the additional 53rd week. Operating margin for the quarter is projected between 14% and 14.2% compared with 13.6% recorded in the year-ago quarter.
