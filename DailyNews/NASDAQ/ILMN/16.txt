      NextSeq™ 550Dx instrument, the company’s second FDA-regulated and CE-IVD 
      marked next-generation sequencing (NGS) system. The company also 
      announced that the intended use for the MiSeq™Dx instrument has been 
      updated to include the use of DNA libraries generated from 
      formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, paving the way for 
      clinical labs to use FFPE samples when developing clinical tests for new 
      applications. With the NextSeq 550Dx and the MiSeqDx, Illumina now has a 
      highly robust diagnostic NGS product portfolio capable of covering a 
      broad range of clinical applications to serve almost any clinical lab 
      need for NGS-based in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products.
    
NextSeq 550Dx

      Illumina introduces the NextSeq 550Dx instrument, which is the second 
      FDA regulated CE-IVD market platform to deliver the power of 
      high-throughput NGS to the clinical laboratory. With dual boot 
      functionality, the NextSeq 550Dx platform includes a diagnostic mode (Dx 
      mode) and a research mode, which provides the flexibility to perform 
      both clinical research and develop a range of IVD assays on a single 
      instrument. For large clinical laboratories, the NextSeq 550Dx 
      instrument offers a validated high-throughput platform and will soon 
      provide access to an expanding pipeline of clinical applications in 
      oncology and reproductive health.
    
      Assays that are run on the NextSeq 550Dx instrument follow a simple 
      process including sequencing and data analysis. The setup of workflows 
      for different applications are fully integrated in NextSeq 550Dx 
      software. The instrument also offers fully-integrated onboard analysis 
      software with modular software architecture to support current and 
      future assays.
    
      “NGS is beginning to play a significant role in the clinic,” said Garret 
      Hampton, Executive Vice President of Clinical Genomics at Illumina. 
      “Illumina is working to provide clinical solutions that support the 
      diagnosis and management of complex diseases, as well as expanding the 
      IVD menu.”

MiSeqDx

      The expanded intended use of the MiSeqDx instrument, which was the first 
      FDA regulated NGS sequencer, enables the development of additional 
      advanced diagnostic products and services at clinical labs by giving 
      clinicians access to information generated on Illumina’s NGS technology. 
      In addition to the updated intended use for the MiSeqDx system, Illumina 
      also offers the regulated MiSeqDx Reagent Kit v3, the latest version of 
      Illumina sequencing chemistry available to MiSeqDx customers, and the 
      TruSeq™ Custom Amplicon Kit Dx for library preparation. These new 
      products replace the MiSeqDx Universal Kit 1.0, which was regulated by 
      the FDA in 2013 and allowed clinical labs to conduct DNA analysis using 
      DNA obtained from human whole blood.
    
      “The expansion and launch of these regulated platforms represent 
      regulatory milestones important to the clinical community,” said Kathy 
      Davy, Vice President of Marketing, Clinical Genomics at Illumina. “The 
      most relevant genetic information that can help cancer patients is often 
      contained in FFPE tissues removed during surgery. Information gleaned 
      from these samples can inform clinicians about tumor biology and help 
      guide therapeutic selection.”
    
      Illumina has updated the existing intended use for the MiSeqDx system to 
      include the use of FFPE sample inputs for assays performed on the 
      instrument. This update will support the launch of the following new 
      reagent kits:
    
      The MiSeqDx now has the following IVD menu:
    
      Illumina and its IVD development partners are now developing assays that 
      use FFPE as a starting point on the MiSeqDx instrument and are working 
      to bring additional IVD tests to the MiSeqDx. For more information on 
      the expanded use of the MiSeqDx system, visit http://www.illumina.com/miseqdx.
