GOOGL – Google is doing a poor job handling fake news for breaking stories, often promoting false information in its results when stories are new.Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) employs some of the smartest and most skilled engineers on earth, but even the tech world’s best and brightest are having a tough time preventing the dissemination of fake news.This is especially true in cases of breaking news events where little information is available. As SFGate reports, this is the exact environment that these falsehoods prosper in, and Google is unfortunately promoting outright lies in many cases:“As soon as an event happens, everything is new,” said Nate Dame, a search specialist at marketing firm Propecta. “There’s no system for the algorithm to filter out truth and reality.”After the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting, several accounts seemed to coordinate an effort to smear Geary Danley, a man misidentified as the shooter, with false claims about his political ties. There were no existing Web pages or videos broadcasting that Danley was innocent, and in the absence of verified information, Google’s algorithms rewarded the lies, placing inaccurate tweets, videos and posts at the top of search results. A month later, when Devin Patrick Kelley shot and killed 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, YouTube videos and tweets mislabeled him as “antifa,” a term for radical, antifascist protesters. This was not true, yet Google displayed these posts prominently.The solution is a difficult to ascertain. Google, like most tech firms, relies entirely on automated ranking systems to determine the best match for a search. A lack of human intervention is seen as an imperative, to keep costs low, but moreso to maintain a position of neutrality.But when robotic neutrality is allowing fake stories to proliferate, something has to be done. Facebook has committed hundreds of new people toward cleaning up its platform — maybe it’s time Google does the same.Alphabet Inc shares closed at $1,056.52 on Friday, up $4.60 (+0.44%). Year-to-date, GOOGL has gained 33.32%, versus a 18.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.GOOGL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.
