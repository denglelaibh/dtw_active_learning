Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockChip maker Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) has pulled off a blistering performance this year, with its shares doubling. The return has exceeded most of the other top tech operators like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Because of this, the company has continued to be an innovator in its industry. But MU has also been restrained with other expenses and has focused on a low-cost pricing strategy to gain more scale.Here are just some of the innovations:Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/micron-3-reasons-to-be-bullish/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
