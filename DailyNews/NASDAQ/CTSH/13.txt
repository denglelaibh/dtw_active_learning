His purchase was the latest by a director after a $1.1 million buy on Nov. 15 by John Flannery, the chairman and chief executive officer, and Steven Mollenkopf’s decision to grab $100,000 of shares the following day.The company leaders are placing substantial bets on Flannery’s ability to reverse a deep slump in the shares, which have fallen 43 percent this year as GE contends with challenges in the power-generation and oil markets. In addition to cutting the dividend and unloading at least $20 billion in assets, the CEO plans to kick out half the company’s 18 directors while bringing on three new representatives.The company hasn’t said who will go as part of a purge that will reduce the board size to 12 members.
