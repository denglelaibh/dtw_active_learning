Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that CELG may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for CELG is 36.34%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 89.29%, tells a different story, and suggests that CELG currently trades in overbought territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Celgene Corporation (CELG) average trading volume of 8,462,476 during the past month is 78.02% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?CELG is currently undervalued by -15.71% relative to the average 1-year price target of $123.97 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for CELG over the next year.How risky is the stock? When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market.Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) has a beta of 1.80, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. CELG therefore has a above average level of market risk.
