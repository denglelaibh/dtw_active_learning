Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockShares of videogame maker Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) slipped more than 3% this past week as the company reported revenue and earnings which approximated analyst expectations. The game developer has been on a very interesting ride in recent years, with its share price appreciating more than 8-fold over the past five years on earnings strength and traction relating to some of the company’s core products.With such a high degree of forward momentum built into EA’s share price, it is no surprise to many investors that profit-taking and investor complacency have resulted in a near-term dip in the company’s stock price this past week. The long-term ability of the company to continue to shift toward profitable growth, however, remains solid, and this latest small dip may provide bullish investors with a buying opportunity heading into the company’s third quarter.Here’s a look at how the company’s earnings shaped up, and some of the earnings drivers which could take EA shares even higher in 2018.The company reported top line revenue numbers of $1.18 billion this past quarter (in line with analyst expectations), and a net loss of $22 million or $0.07 per share, narrowing the gap from the quarterly loss of $38 million or $0.13 per share in the same quarter last year.Despite posting a net loss this previous quarter, EA has remained consistent in returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases which amounted to 1.3 million shares or approximately 0.4% of the total float this past quarter, with the total value of share repurchases increasing from $127 million for Q2 2016 to $153 million for this past quarter.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/ea-stock-dips-earnings/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
