Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockElectronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) is learning a painful lesson with its Star Wars: Battlefront II rollout. While movie audiences are passive, gamers are active. If they think a publisher is messing with them, they have ways of fighting back movie audiences never dreamed of.This is causing pain and consternation on Wall Street. The EA stock price is down almost 10% since Halloween, as protests over how it seeks to profit from the game force it to pull back, and as investors digest a horrible earnings report.EA stock rose with sports games that had a built-in audience, and a simple transactional business model. It is now in a cloud era where audiences are in control and where money must be made in other ways to pay high development costs.It’s like if you handed this old man a console keypad. EA doesn’t even know the rules of the new game it is playing.EA figured it had an easy win, licensing Star Wars from Disney, in entering the cloud battlefield. The same was true for investors. Strong pre-orders of the game, which carries an initial price tag of $60, caused them to speculate on a big win.But the costs of developing such a game are huge, and EA saw this sticker price as an entry fee, like a Disney fee to enter one of its parks. You wouldn’t walk into Epcot with an empty wallet.EA decided to monetize its game by charging gamers to unlock specific characters and game play. Gamers reacted the way they would to a Disney park demanding cash for paid visitors to get on Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride.They protested. They screamed on Twitter and screamed on Reddit. EA heard them and backed away, turning off the micro-transaction capability “for now.”EA should have known better. Rival Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) ran into the same kind of backlash with its Destiny 2 game.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/electronic-arts-is-learning-painful-lesson/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
