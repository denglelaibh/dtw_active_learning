Menu Breaking news sponsored byBroadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been in the news for the past few days. The headlines have been of potential buyout of Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM). Both stocks are rallying on those prospects. I don’t believe it will eventually happen, so I want to short AVGO on that notion.Before you send out calls for my arrest, this is not a dis against either company’s prospects. In fact, I will use the value that I see in AVGO stock to completely finance my bet.Yes, this is a “bet” because my entire thesis is that the headline will fade, so the outcome is binary. And just like Las Vegas, binary trades are more gambling than investing.Fundamentally, there is no doubt that the financial metrics for AVGO suggest that it is expensive. Its price-to-earnings ratio is almost 300 and it runs negative net margins. Even its price-to-book value is double most other stocks in the sector.In today’s bearish bet I am not trying to short it because of valuation. I realize that in this uber-bullish stock market traders don’t care about aggressive valuations.
Click to Enlarge Technically, AVGO stock is flying high, as it’s up 60% year-to-date. Although it’s not as high as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) which is up over 90%, but it is twice as much as the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ:QQQ).Expectations for AVGO stock are high. Even after this spike, the stock is still near the low end of Wall Street’s lowest price target and 8% below the average. Furthermore, all analysts who cover it have a BUY rating on it. So clearly the boat is tipped to one side.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/broadcom-ltd-avgo-stock-flying-high/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
