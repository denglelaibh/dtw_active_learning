Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockUntil recently, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) seemed left out of the big-cap tech rally. The INTC stock price was basically flat between mid-2014 and mid-2017. Intel news seemed overshadowed by the constant coverage of smaller rivals like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).INTC was a tech stock, but it traded more like an old blue chip, with minimal growth and volatility. Many investors were buying INTC stock more for the dividend than for capital appreciation. Suddenly, that’s changed.The INTC stock price has gained a whopping 30% just since late August, a huge move for what looked like a stodgy old stock. It doesn’t look like the bull run here is finished, either. I liked INTC heading into Q3 earnings last month. I agree with my InvestorPlace colleague Dana Blankenhorn, who argued that a big Q3 blowout suggests more upside going forward.INTC stock remains cheap, and Intel news looks good. More broadly, the story at Intel sounds a lot like those we’ve heard elsewhere. Those stories have played out well, and I believe the same will be true for INTC.Investors couldn’t ask for much more from Intel’s Q3 report. The company raised full-year EPS guidance for the third straight quarter. Excluding antivirus software maker McAfee, whose business is in terminal decline, revenue rose 6% year-over-year. Sales in the Client Computing Group (i.e., the PC-exposed segment) were flat. But in what Intel calls “data-centric” businesses like IoT (Internet of Things) and data center, sales rose a sharp 15%.Gross margin did weaken modestly, but operating expenses were leveraged. Non-GAAP operating income rose 8%, and non-GAAP net income rose 25%. The latter figure did benefit from a gain on a sale as Intel cut its stake in Dutch equipment maker ASML Holding NV (ADR) (NASDAQ:ASML), but Intel also had a modestly higher tax rate in the quarter.The growth figures aren’t torrid. They certainly don’t compare to Nvidia or even AMD, but they’re progress. And there are more catalysts on the horizon. The acquisition of Mobileye closed in Q3, and Intel now can begin to ramp its strategy in autonomous driving. Intel is trying to fight off Nvidia in data center, and YTD results show some strength on that front, or at least a market large enough for two key players.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/intel-story-sounds-positively-familiar/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
