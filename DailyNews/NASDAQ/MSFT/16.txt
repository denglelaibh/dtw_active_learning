Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) went public in 1986, a minnow next to mighty International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). The saying was you couldn’t get fired for buying IBM. MSFT stock holders hoped for the same.Today Microsoft is everything IBM once was, and more. It is the dominant enterprise software company, with a market cap of almost $650 billion, and its cash and short-term investments of $138 billion is closing in on IBM’s total market cap of $139 billion.After stumbling during the last decade under U.S. government antitrust charges, Microsoft is now a dominant cloud services provider. The Redmond, Wash. company recently announced quarterly revenues of $24.5 billion, up 12% year over year, and net income of $6.6 billion, up 16% Y/y. Its cloud revenues were up 89%. This is happening despite Microsoft’s loss of once-impregnable monopolies in operating systems and office applications, and despite its failure to crack the mobile phone market, not to mention its loss of dominance in video game consoles to Sony Corp. (ADR) (NYSE:SNE)It’s happening because Microsoft found a new leader within its ranks in 2014, Satya Nadella, who focused resources on the Azure cloud, on putting all the company’s software on it, and on building and hosting software from that base.Nadella also ended the company’s ongoing war with open source, and has built a corporate culture based on empathy, an often-overlooked value in the highly competitive U.S. tech market.It took time to win over Microsoft critics and cynics. I didn’t personally buy in until October 2015, but since then my investment is up 57%. Microsoft’s growth trajectory is now set, and revenues for the December quarter, to be reported early next year, are expected to reach $28.3 billion, with profits of 86 cents a share, nearly matching the most recent quarter.Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/microsoft-msft-everything-ibm-once-was-and-more/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
