A weighted alpha below 0 suggest additional declines. Therefore, there is certainly still some pain for investors who want to avoid this falling stock. Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha. Support is likely to come between $25.5 a share to $25.14 a share level. However, if the NBL shares go below $25.14 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 2.75% decline from the most recent price.

MSFT’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 63.75%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s latest quote $84.88 $0.31 1.2% will find technical support in $84.25 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for Microsoft Corporation traders.

The $83.61 level represents at least another 1.5% downside for the stock from its current price. If Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares can stay above the price resistance around $85.29 a share, that could help propel Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) higher to the next line of resistance at $85.69 a share.

MSFT is down around 30.73% from its 12-month high of $58.8 notched on Dec 02, 2016 but is 50.48% above its highest point the past 12 months of $42.03 a share.
