Profitability and ReturnsA high growth rate isn’t necessarily valuable to investors. In fact, companies that overinvest in low return projects just to achieve a high growth rate can actually destroy shareholder value. Profitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. We’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) to measure this. EBITDA margin of 10.52% for Wabash National Corporation (WNC). PCAR’s ROI is 3.10% while WNC has a ROI of 19.20%. The interpretation is that WNC’s business generates a higher return on investment than PCAR’s.Cash Flow

PCAR is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsA cheap stock is not necessarily a value stock.

PCAR is currently priced at a -11.86% to its one-year price target of 75.95. Comparatively, WNC is -15.44% relative to its price target of 22.60. This suggests that WNC is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.60 for PCAR and 2.80 for WNC, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for WNC.Risk and VolatilityBeta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. PCAR has a beta of 1.24 and WNC’s beta is 1.75. PCAR’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentShort interest is another tool that analysts use to gauge investor sentiment. It represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares that are being shorted. PCAR has a short ratio of 3.43 compared to a short interest of 25.64 for WNC.
