Menu Breaking news sponsored byIn just the last decade, the automotive industry has drastically changed, in ways that we likely haven’t really noticed. Companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are redefining what it means to own a luxury vehicle, while Silicon Valley tech giants like Uber have not only helped create a new industry—ride-hailing—but it is also (controversially) working to further the development of self-driving vehicles.And Uber isn’t just the only one. There is, of course, its burgeoning arch-nemesis Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its own self-driving car unit, Waymo, in addition to the laundry list of traditional automakers like Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) hoping to debut this technology in the near future.While the dream of fully-functioning self-driving cars and other big technologies certainly loom both near and far, there are other facets of the auto industry that investors should make sure do not get lost in the shuffle. With this in mind, check out these three auto stocks to buy now.Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, Paccar Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) designs and manufactures premium light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks. Its Truck segment operates under the Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF nameplates, while its Parts division includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Mexico and South America.Right now, Paccar is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and shares have risen about 70% this year.
