Menu Breaking news sponsored byWeibo Corp (ADR) (NASDAQ:WB) announced earnings Nov. 7. As a result of standout WB earnings, WB stock is up 13% over the past five days of trading.Like a runaway train that can’t be stopped, Weibo is on its way to $200; the only question is how long it takes to get there. In November alone, two InvestorPlace contributors have written about WB earnings and the stock’s potential upside. But it’s what InvestorPlace’s Dana Blankenhorn said in early October that has me pondering an investment in SINA Corp (NASDAQ:SINA).“Ian Bezek calls it red hot, because it’s a ’10-bagger,’ having risen 1,000% since 2015,” Blankenhorn wrote. “Tom Taulli notes that the company is ‘running on all cylinders.’ Despite its huge gains, Larry Ramer says it is ‘still attractive.’” Those are some mighty persuasive words. Interestingly, WB stock has gained as much in the past week as it’s gained from the beginning of October highlighting the importance of WB earnings, or any company’s earnings for that matter, in driving the share price higher. Now back to Dana’s words of wisdom.Blankenhorn’s thesis in his Oct. 2 article centers around the idea that while Weibo is booming, Sina owns 46% of Weibo’s common shares and 72% of its votes, thereby controlling the Chinese social media platform. Yet, Sina’s market cap of $7.4 billion is just 30% of Weibo’s at $24.5 billion. The difference left Blankenhorn scratching his head.Blankenhorn reasoned it made less sense to own WB stock than SINA stock. Why? Because with Sina you’re getting a piece of Weibo at 39% off — 46% of Weibo’s $24.5 billion market cap less Sina’s market cap of $7.4 billion equals $3.9 billion divided by $12.2 billion which equals 35% — which makes owning the parent a much better deal. Case closed, right? Not so fast.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/wb-stock-good-buy/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
