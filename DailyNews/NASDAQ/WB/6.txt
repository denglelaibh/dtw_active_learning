Menu Breaking news sponsored byIn addition to blowout numbers from e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), the market also got a very strong quarter from social media platform Weibo Corp (ADR) (NASDAQ:WB). In fact, WB earnings were so good (yet another clean beat-and-raise quarter) that WB stock rocketed to all-time highs. It now trades over $107 and has rallied 130% over the past year.The China Internet growth narrative remains red hot. But this huge run in WB stock isn’t over. In fact, I think WB stock could still nearly double over the next 5 years.Here’s why.Often dubbed the Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) of China, Weibo is a pure-play on the red-hot China internet growth narrative.This growth narrative is still in its early innings.China’s middle class is growing and urbanizing. A critical part of this urbanization is the mass proliferation of smartphone and social media usage. Look no further than the stock charts of Weibo and Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) to understand that this is an accelerating growth story.WB earnings also underscore that this growth story is still in its early innings. WB reported that the monthly active user base had swelled to 376 monthly active users in the third quarter, up 15 million sequentially. Last third quarter, WB also added 15 million new users. The third quarter before that, WB added 10 million new users.Clearly, there is reason to believe that this growth narrative is actually getting better.In fact, smoothing out for seasonality in net adds, Weibo is on a multi-quarter trend of adding roughly 20 million new monthly users per quarter (which has been translating to roughly 30% year-over-year growth, give or take a few percentage points). That is pretty strong growth, and it won’t slow anytime soon.The combined user count at Tencent’s WeChat and Weixin was 963 million last quarter.Weibo likely won’t hit a billion users any time soon. Tencent’s WeChat and Weixin were adding roughly 40 million users per quarter when they had around 350 million monthly actives (comparable size to Weibo currently). That is essentially double the user add growth rate of Weibo.But Weibo is on track for current growth rates to sustain themselves for a long, long time. Currently, it feels like the longevity and magnitude of this growth narrative is being underappreciated by the market.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/wb-stock-more-upside/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
