Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockWhile the shine may have worn off Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the eyes of the general public, MSFT stock remains one of the steadiest performers in the investment world.This, despite that fact that is doesn’t get the same press as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), isn’t a Wall Street darling like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), and that its best days are most certainly behind it.In fact, MSFT has been a better stock than many of its more-publicized contemporaries in the tech world. This includes Apple, the company that more than a decade ago essentially replaced Microsoft as Wall Street’s top dog.To wit: In the last two years, MSFT stock has risen 50%; AAPL is up 45%. Going back even further, in the last five years Microsoft stock has ballooned more than 200%; AAPL stock is up 127%.Meanwhile, MSFT pays a higher dividend (2% yield) than AAPL (1.5% yield), grew earnings (13%) faster than Apple (11%) in the most recent quarter, and has nearly double the cash in its coffers, with about 18% less debt.All of this isn’t to put down AAPL stock. After all, 45% growth in two years is hardly worthy of mocking.It is merely to point out that MSFT stock, which endured a big sell-off after the recession, and which attracts just a fraction of the front page headlines as AAPL, is in the midst of a quiet resurgence.There’s been nothing particularly flashy about Microsoft’s comeback. The company’s sales have improved in seven of the last eight years, but never by more than 11%. Profit growth has been consistently in double digits of late.In both cases, Microsoft’s top- and bottom-line growth is either accelerating or holding steady, at a time when Apple’s sales have plummeted from better than 60% growth in 2011 to a mere 19% expected growth in its current fiscal year.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/msft-stock-more-reliable/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
