Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockOver the past few years, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has become an entertainment staple in many U.S. households. Combine the popularity of its online streaming service with the development of its own high quality, exclusive content, and it’s no wonder that NFLX stock has climbed more than 60% year-to-date and nearly 1,900% over the past five years.But, as great as this progress is, many Netflix stock investors are probably wondering: How long can it really last?In my previous article about NFLX stock, I related a Bernstein report on the declining use of traditional cable services by children to Netflix’s long-term popularity.I argued that although the findings did not directly relate to Netflix, they did apply to the general cordless mindset that continues to become the standard in the U.S. — a mindset that greatly benefits NFLX stock in the long-term.I still believe in the long-term success of the company; however, when you look at the bigger picture for Netflix stock, it’s also important to consider other elements outside the cordless movement itself.More specifically, can NFLX maintain its strength with a slew of new (and old) competition coming for its throne?For now, the company continues to impress shareholders. In fact, its latest earnings report cited “5.3 million new subscribers … its best net add in history” and “[t]he bulk of that, an impressive 4.5 million new subscribers, came from overseas.”But the impressive growth story can only continue for so long … right?The long-term picture for Netflix stock gets a little muddier when you consider the potential impact of future competition from the likes of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), along with current — and growing — competition from Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime Video and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube.Earlier this year, Disney reported that it will cease distributing its content via Netflix starting in 2018 and instead create its own streaming platform as well as a streaming service for ESPN.Of course, the absence of Disney alone is not enough to put an end to NFLX stock’s run, but its abandonment represents a dispersal of quality content. Beyond the enticement of existing/well-known films, there are only so many top-tier writers, actors and directors to grab for exclusive content and the more services there are to choose from, the less plentiful they may be on Netflix.In the years ahead, customers will have even more choices to make; and the inclination to choose multiple services, or at least choose Netflix as one of them, could decrease as the price for its services continues to rise.This, of course, assumes that competing services offer viable alternatives to what Netflix currently produces and plans to create in the years ahead. And NFLX stock isn’t going down without an epic, Hollywood-style fight.In the wake of Disney’s departure, the company plans to increase the already-Herculian output of its original films, with the company expecting to produce 80 NFLX-exculsive movies in 2018. The quality of these films is still to be determined, but the company is clearly continuing to grow its own content at an impressive rate.When you combine this new film-based content with the acclaim of its pre-existing “Originals” like Stranger Things, Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards, it’s highly likely that some of these films could draw in new subscribers while retaining the interest of old subscribers.But even the big-time successes of Netflix aren’t invulnerable to unexpected threats.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/netflix-inc-wont-go-down-without-a-fight/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
