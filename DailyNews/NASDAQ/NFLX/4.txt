Menu Breaking news sponsored byThe decision by Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) to go head-to-head with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) as a video streaming service temporarily halted the momentum in Netflix stock during November, but it will not have a dramatic impact on the company.That’s because, as anyone who reads a quarterly report knows, Netflix’ U.S. operations are already peaking. The only way for it to grow revenue here is to raise prices, as it has begun to do, and there is a limit to that.The real growth engine for Netflix is its international operations, where revenue is now nearly equal to that of the U.S., having nearly doubled year-over-year, with losses turning into profits and the market barely scratched.In these markets analysts feel Netflix has little to fear from Disney, and much more to fear from companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:BABA), which can grow in a “captive” Chinese market and then compete across Asia.Even there, the truth is more complex.China’s streaming market is more competitive than that of the U.S., and Netflix has found a way in, a content licensing deal with iQiyi, a unit of Baidu Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) signed in April.There is also Tencent Video, owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), whose market cap exceeds that of Alibaba. Tencent has been working with HBO, a unit of Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX), since 2014. An AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) purchase of Time Warner would bring them into the mix.Alibaba is represented by Youku Todou, acquired in 2016. It began with a free, ad-supported model like that of Google’s YouTube, a unit of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and is now trying to convert users into customers. Its continuing losses may be behind the recent resignation of Alibaba Pictures head Yu Yongfu, previously considered a potential successor to Jack Ma himself.At some point, Chinese leadership is going to emerge, and that leader will likely be much larger, by market cap, than Netflix. Baidu, the smallest of the three potential Netflix competitors, is almost as large by market cap as Netflix right now, while the other two Chinese dragons are similar in size to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).The Chinese market competition, in short, has yet to play out.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/nflx-stock-positioned-growth/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
