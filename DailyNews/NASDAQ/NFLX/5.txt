Menu Breaking news sponsored byWith the holiday season fast approaching, retail stocks have been in the spotlight. However, video streaming service provider Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) should be on your radar as well because the firm is gearing up for a big year in 2018. NFLX stock already is trading at all-time highs, but don’t be put off by its meteoric rise. The firm still has further to climb.Netflix has a solid game plan for the upcoming year and investors who stick around are likely to be rewarded.One part of Netflix’s business that has gotten a lot of attention has been the firm’s focus on original content. The company has poured billions into developing multiple hit series and that’s expected to continue into 2018. In 2018, NFLX management says it is planning to spend somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion on programming with an end goal of eventually having original content make up half of it’s total library.That’s a big deal because the benefits of original content versus licensed programs is still unclear. According to Nielsen, original content isn’t actually all that popular when you compare it to “back catalog,” or licensed shows. The ratings service claims that its studies show that people spend only 20% of the time they spend streaming on original content.On the surface, those claims make NFLX’s strategy look frivolous, but there are other factors to consider. First of all, the Nielsen ratings aren’t exactly comprehensive because they only take into account what people are watching on TV, not what they’re watching on tablets, computers and smartphones. Secondly, original content plays a massive role in driving subscriptions and renewals, a huge part of NFLX’s business.With NFLX upping its subscription prices, it is important that the company maintains its place as most-popular streaming service. Many people are willing to pay monthly simply to keep up with some of their favorite shows. As long as Netflix is able to continue producing hit shows, the firm will have greater price elasticity.Another reason I believe NFLX stock price will continue climbing in the year to come is the fact that the firm has a lot of growth opportunities as it pushes its service further afield.Last year Netflix made its service available in 190 countries across the globe, and I think we’ll start to see those investments pay off in the coming year. Because NFLX uses its own customer data to make its service better, it takes time for the firm to gain traction in new markets. Netflix has proven itself to be successful analyzing customer data to determine what provides customers with the most value and tailoring the streaming experience depending on local tastes.The other reason NFLX is likely to be successful in its expansion efforts is that the company’s customer satisfaction ratings have been impressive. That makes it’s free-trial an extremely effective tool in hooking in new subscribers. NFLX’s massive customer database means that the company can provide users with a hard-to-resist value proposition during their trial period.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/nflx-stock-keep-climbing/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
