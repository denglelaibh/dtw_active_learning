Menu Breaking news sponsored byAs far as I can remember I haven’t written about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) since last November. At the time I gave three reasons why NFLX stock was worth its insane valuation. Today, I revisit those reasons to see whether they still hold water.The NFLX stock price is up 73% since I wrote about the streaming service November 15, 2016. Growth investors saw the big picture while value investors were left in the dust. The question is whether it can deliver a repeat performance. To answer that, I’ll look at where it was and where it’s going to determine the odds of Netflix succeeding. In my article, I opened the piece wondering why anyone would pay 300 times earnings for a company that had negative free cash flow. That was Q3 2016. One year later it’s trading at 156 times 2017 earnings estimates, 86 times forward 2018 earnings and 52 times forward 2019 earnings. Profits are heading in the right direction. However, free cash flow only gotten marginally better — negative $465 million in Q3 2017 vs. $506 million a year earlier — which suggests it’s still spending more on content than it’s bringing in. Eventually, that’s got to change, but given it continues to grow outside the U.S. much like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), investors are willing to give it a pass — for now. Netflix’s day of reckoning will come. Just not today.In last year’s third quarter, NFLX grew paid memberships by 4.3% sequentially. In this year’s third quarter it grew paid memberships on a sequential basis by 5.0% to 104.2 million, a year over year increase of 24.9%. In Q3 2016, it increased paid memberships by 26.1%.I’d call that a wash. In my opinion, the velocity of growth remains intact. “Picking up three million members outside the U.S. each quarter, Netflix should see its international memberships overtake its U.S. memberships sometime in Q2 or Q3 2017,” I wrote November 15. “And that’s without China coming on board anytime soon.”Well, would you look at that? Netflix’s paid international memberships passed the U.S. in the third quarter. As for China, the company announced in April that it would enter the country through a licensing arrangement with iQiyi, one of China’s largest video streaming services. There’s still plenty of fish to fry outside the U.S.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/nflx-stock-insane-valuation/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
