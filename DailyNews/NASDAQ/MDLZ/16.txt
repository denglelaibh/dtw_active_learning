Comparatively, HSY’s free cash flow per share was +0.42. On a percent-of-sales basis, MDLZ’s free cash flow was 0.06% while HSY converted 1.19% of its revenues into cash flow.

Stocks with a beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. MDLZ has a beta of 0.99 and HSY’s beta is 0.37. HSY’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentThe analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level.
