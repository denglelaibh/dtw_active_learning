At the end of November, share prices have skyrocketed 60% higher year to date.Â Here's a quick recap of how Amazon pulled off this market-smashing performance, just in case you need a reminder.A steady drumbeat of impressive business results provided a strong foundation for this year's massive gains.Image source: Amazon.Amazon smashed Wall Street's earnings estimates in February's report of last year's holiday quarter. Three months later, the e-commerce giant surpassed all expectations in the first quarter. The company took a breather from earnings surprises in the second quarter, but the third-quarter update absolutely crushed Wall Street's targets.The Amazon Web Services (AWS) division is boosting Amazon's bottom-line profits in a big way while the Prime free shipping club keeps online shoppers loyal. Together, this one-two punch delivers plenty of shareholder value.We Amazon investors had plenty of news to keep us busy along the way to these earnings-based milestones.Many investors write Amazon off due to its sky-high price-to-earnings ratio. The stock currently trades at 300 times trailing earnings and 150 times forward estimates.But those figures are a product of Amazon's tax accounting procedures. Net income may have stopped at just $1.9 billion over the last four quarters, but free cash flows clocked in at $7.2 billion. EBITDA profits, which arguably measure a company's operating income in its purest form, have nearly tripled over the last three years to stop at a cool $14 billion. There are many ways to measure a company's profitability, and Amazon comes out looking like a cash machine in most cases.The Whole Foods buyout is taking Amazon down some brand-new paths, and makes the company more comparable to traditional retailers with networks of brick-and-mortar stores. That being said, Whole Foods represents approximately 10% of Amazon's total sales and won't move the company's needle very far. The deal's long-term effects may be more powerful, but it's not a game changer in the short run.John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.
