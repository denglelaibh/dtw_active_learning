Menu Breaking news sponsored byIn the capital markets, there is no such thing as a “sure thing”. The very nature of investing means that for someone to win, somebody else has to lose. The technical term is “zero-sum game”; I just call it common sense. However, if a unicorn investment did exist, its name would be Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Against its technology-centric peers, AMZN stock has the right mix of tangible and intangible attributes.Primarily, when investors consider Amazon stock, they look at the e-commerce industry. In the second quarter of 2017, e-commerce accounted for nearly 9% of total retail sales. This trend shows no sign of ending. But the more important aspect is that, at no point, did online retail sales recede. Even during the recessions that began in 2001 and 2008, e-commerce growth only went flat.Needless to say, a robust underlying industry is a tremendous advantage — hence, the ever-rising AMZN stock price. But it’s not just the dominance in e-commerce, nor its disruptive nature in traditional retail, that makes Amazon formidable. As it made abundantly clear with the Whole Foods Market takeover, AMZN is not afraid to shock the markets.One only needs to look at the volatility caused to Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ:SFM) to fully appreciate what an energized Amazon can do.Still, I can see why investors may be hesitant to jump on Amazon stock now. Year to date, shares have climbed to nearly 52%. A good chunk of that came recently, when AMZN gapped up to, and eventually breached, $1,100.A good argument exists that the AMZN stock price has well exceeded its earnings growth potential. For instance, shares trade at 143 times 2018 earnings estimates.Although I’m not a big “price-earnings ratio guy,” it’s not a metric to ignore, either.Nevertheless, in five or six years time, we may look at the AMZN stock price currently as a great deal. On the surface, it sounds absolutely insane. But, truth be told, Amazon may be the most realistic contender to become the first $1 trillion company.Amazon started life selling books online. Now, the rules of engagement have changed to include almost anything. By purchasing AMZN stock at 143 times forward earnings, you’re speculating on events in which the company has consistently delivered. I love InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin’s explanation.Vince writes: “And ask yourself: is there a business you’d more rather own than Amazon? If so, the list is short. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has the world’s most dominant brand. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is visited daily by 18% of the world’s population. But no company is better-positioned across so many spaces, cloud computing, online shopping, artificial intelligence, than Amazon.com.”Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/amzn-stock-no-sure-thing/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
