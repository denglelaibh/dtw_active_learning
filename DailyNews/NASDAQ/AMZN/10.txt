Menu Breaking news sponsored byAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking over the world, and the AMZN stock price is following. However, it cannot do it without help. It needs lots of help to deliver all its packages and an army of drones isn’t going to suffice.That’s why it set up a strategic partnership with and purchased warrants in two air freight carriers: Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAWW) and Air Transport Services Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG).For the former, Atlas Air is a solid and robust air cargo business. Prior to the AMZN deal, it was flying 49 planes, mostly 747’s. Its operation is global, and growing nicely.Airlines of any kind don’t grow YOY for the most part, as far as net income, because of the need for capex. Smaller companies like this will have on and off years for capex.AAWW stock had $107 million in net income in FY14, and $7 million in FY15, thanks to an additional $188 million in capex. Net income was back to $41 million in FY16 and $59 million in the TTM.Amazon was handed warrants as part of the strategic deal. Purchase of these warrants could mean AMZN taking over 30 percent of AAWW until 2022, at a price of only $37.50.Now, on the day of this big announcement, AAWW stock rose from $37 to $47per share, has since risen as high as $67 and is now back to $53. There’s no reason for the decline, so it’s a buy.ATSG stock made a similar deal, with warrants that could mean 20% ownership for AMZN at a purchase price of $9.73 per share. ATSG jumped from $11.50 to over $14 after the news broke. ATSG stock has hit $26.75 and is presently at $23.33, also a buy.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/amzn-stock-transportation-buy/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
