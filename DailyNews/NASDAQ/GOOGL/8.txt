GOOGL – Is Alphabet wasting too much money on underperforming “other bets”?.Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is famous for spreading billions of dollars around in “other bets” that are mostly unrelated to its core businesses, most of which have been total failures.As The Motley Fool reports, it’s high time the search engine giant start answering some tough questions about these investments:Alphabet spends massive amounts of money on its “other bets” — essentially, moonshot technology research in pursuit of the next big thing. These expenditures have been a consistent, and large, feature of Alphabet’s financial statements for almost a decade.However, a company that fails to responsibly invest retained earnings isn’t doing right by its investors. Were such long-shot investments a one-time event, it wouldn’t be a big deal, especially for a company with a monopolistic search engine that generates lots of cash. But over time, investors have to wonder if the company would have been better off using its moonshot cash to buy back shares, or make more directly accretive acquisitions. Other Bets reported an $861 million operating loss in the latest quarter despite 53% revenue growth. Unlike Amazon, whose moonshots include the wildly successful AWS, Alexa, and more, Google’s investments — aside from Waymo, its self-driving unit — seem highly unlikely to ever make money.That’s a problem that will come to roost at one point or another.Alphabet Inc shares were trading at $1,069.63 per share on Tuesday morning, down $2.38 (-0.22%). Year-to-date, GOOGL has gained 34.98%, versus a 18.50% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.GOOGL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.
