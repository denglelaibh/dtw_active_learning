Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that EBAY may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for EBAY is 38.24%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 23.84%, tells a different story, and suggests that EBAY currently trades in oversold territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. eBay Inc. (EBAY) average trading volume of 7,952,050 during the past month is 6.91% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?EBAY is currently undervalued by -9.57% relative to the average 1-year price target of $39.29 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.50, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for EBAY over the next year.How risky is the stock? No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market.eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) has a beta of 1.39, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole.
