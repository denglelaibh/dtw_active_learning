EBAY – eBay is increasingly using AI to help connect shoppers with products they might like.eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) hosts one of the largest shopping platforms on earth, and the sheer variety of items for sale from millions of sellers can be daunting, to say the least.That’s why the e-commerce giant is increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help connect shoppers with the right products at the right time. CNBC has more details:“If we know you like superheroes, there’s a world of things on eBay you don’t even realize we have,” said Bradford Shellhammer, eBay’s head of personalization and engagement.EBay operates one of the world’s largest online marketplaces. It had 168 million active buyers as of the third quarter of this year. Its size and the breadth of its offerings have been a point of distinction when compared against Amazon. “Don’t shop like everybody else” is the theme of one of its holiday advertisements. The challenge, though, has been making sure eBay shoppers find and buy those items.To that end, eBay has invested a lot of money lately in AI. Its new homepage design is more intuitive, and it curates items specifically for each shopper “Netflix style.” It also tags items using a combination of human and machine input. This allows the company to group items not just by similarity, but also by theme — for example, a Thor hammer toy can be grouped with a vintage comic book, not just other Thor toys.The end game is to better predict what shoppers want and make the experience as seamless as possible, while showing off the incredible variety of items eBay has listed. Based on its initial success, investors can expect AI to play a much bigger role in coming years, not just for eBay, but for the e-commerce world in general (not to mention in nearly every other industry on earth).eBay Inc shares were trading at $36.10 per share on Monday morning, up $0.26 (+0.73%). Year-to-date, EBAY has gained 21.59%, versus a 18.22% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.EBAY currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of B (Buy), and is ranked #18 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.
