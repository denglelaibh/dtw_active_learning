Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockReports that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (NASDAQ:FOX) might sell its entertainment assets to Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) at first excited the markets like a stiff martini, but now the hangover is settling in.If Fox controlling shareholder Rupert Murdoch is willing to sell, what does that say about the medium’s future? With AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) temporarily stymied in its efforts to buy Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX), it means two of the three main cable news outlets are facing an uncertain future.That last deserves investor attention.While TV shows like The Simpsons adapt well to internet streaming, cable news networks don’t. The one “talk” show tried on the medium, helmed by Chelsea Handler, was canceled by Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) after just two seasons.News, by its nature, is appointment TV. Younger viewers don’t do appointments. They may not even do TV.Critics like to point out that the median age of a Fox News viewer is 68. But the median age of an MSNBC viewer is 63, the median CNN viewer is 59. For network TV news shows, the demographic news is just as grim.Viewers are rapidly moving from TV to the internet as their primary news source. Most people under 50 already choose the internet for their news, according to Pew Research.After denying the trend for years, media owners have decided now is the time to sell. Time Warner results are driven by the success of networks it bought from Ted Turner in the 1990s, including CNN. Those are the assets the government now demands it sell, that or DirecTv. The strong earnings reported by Fox on Nov. 8 were driven by cable.The question is who will buy? The obvious answer has been infrastructure companies. When Time Warner bought CNN it owned Time Warner Cable, which is now part of Charter Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR). Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), the largest cable operator, bought NBC Universal, which owns MSNBC, in 2011. The AT&T-Time Warner deal was thought to be a similar arrangement.But it’s no longer clear that cable controls delivery infrastructure, even though they own the last mile of the wired internet. Because it’s internet services, in the form of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), that now hold the key to finding an audience.On the internet, there are no channels. There are shows, which can be of any length, from a 20-second clip to a two-hour movie. News is consumed in short bursts, on apps like Google Now, or in a Facebook News Feed, which takes just minutes and, over time, leads users down rabbit holes of related interests.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/the-fall-of-tv-accelerates-with-fox/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
