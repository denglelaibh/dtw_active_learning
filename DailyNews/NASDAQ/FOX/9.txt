Giving color to one asset-sale prospect in the merger between AT&T (T +2.5%) and Time Warner (TWX +1.1%), Lachlan Murdoch says that Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX +3%, FOXA +3.2%) would never be interested in buying news network CNN.CNN has become a much-discussed potential bargaining chip in the merger talks, with claims and counterclaims that selling the network might be required for the merger to get DOJ approval. AT&T chief Randall Stephenson has said he's not open to selling CNN.Meanwhile, Fox is in its own discussions to sell assets, though it expects to retain its broadcast, sports and cable-leading news operations.Murdoch, Fox's executive chairman, told a Business Insider conference that ”We wouldn’t be allowed to buy CNN and we would never be interested in buying CNN." The company might be legally allowed to own both Fox News and CNN but such a deal would draw antitrust scrutiny.See all stocks on the move »
