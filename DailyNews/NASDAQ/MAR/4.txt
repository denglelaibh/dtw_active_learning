A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. MAR has a beta of 1.34 and EXPE’s beta is 0.91. EXPE’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentComparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment.
