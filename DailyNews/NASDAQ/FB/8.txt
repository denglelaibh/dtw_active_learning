FB – Dating app makers are turning to Facebook and LinkedIn to help vet users.Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is often seen as the “phone book of the internet,” where you can find some information on just about everyone of consequence on earth.As CNBC reports, new-age dating apps are leveraging the pervasiveness of the social network to help screen users and ensure they’re legitimate:The Inner Circle is one of those apps. It was founded in 2012 in Amsterdam by David Vermeulen. “We try to focus on people who are inspiring and ambitious,” he says, adding it has more than 500,000 users worldwide.The site uses Facebook and LinkedIn to help vet applicants; runs events, including an annual polo tournament in Richmond, near London, and has a low tolerance for bad photos. “I would say anything is better than a duckface in front of the mirror,” says Vermeulen, using derogatory slang that refers to pouting in photos. “A more serious picture is something we can appreciate.”The app also looks at users’ LinkedIn profiles for further signs that the person is at least ambitious and intellectual enough to create a career-oriented social account. It’s a practice that employers have been using for quite a while now to make sure applicants fit into their expectations, and a natural progression for datings apps that look to move beyond the Tinder era into a deeper and more meaningful type of connection.Facebook Inc shares were unchanged in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, FB has gained 59.09%, versus a 18.08% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.FB currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #4 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.
