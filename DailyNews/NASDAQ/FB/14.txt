Menu Breaking news sponsored byFANG killed it this quarter. Social media leader Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) smashed analyst estimates thanks to FB stock’s robust ad revenue growth on top of healthy margin expansion. Retail leader Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also smashed expectations due to continued strength in the e-commerce business as well as continued dominance in the cloud space.Meanwhile, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported really strong subscriber growth numbers which easily breezed past analyst expectations. Alphabet Inc (NADSAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) bounced back from a European Commission fine-plagued second quarter to report perhaps its best earnings of the year.But not all stocks are treated equally. AMZN stock and GOOG stock rallied big after their reports, while FB stock and NFLX stock dropped.The NFLX drop makes sense. NFLX stock had rallied big into the report. It became a classic “sell the news” event. NFLX stock was depressed for a few days, but then it bounced back.The FB stock price drop makes less sense. FB stock had not rallied big into the report. It wasn’t a classic “sell the news” event. Instead, investors got jittery about increased security spend adversely affecting profitability in the future.Those jitters are overdone, and the selloff is unnecessarily short-sighted. And the FB stock price is headed for $200 soon.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized safety and security over profitability on the company’s most recent earnings call. With his company finding itself on Capitol Hill and on the wrong side of headlines regarding fake news, this emphasis was a smart move.But Zuckerberg and fellow senior management at Facebook went further than just emphasizing safety and security. They actually said expenses would rise a lot more next year than initially anticipated due to increased investment in safety and security.That was a brilliant move.Investors didn’t appreciate it (FB stock sold off because it implies a less rosy margin growth outlook going forward), but the move sets a gold standard for transparency in the digital advertising world, evades a government crackdown (and potentially billion-dollar fines), and will inevitably attract more advertisers to the platform.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/facebook-head-over-200/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
