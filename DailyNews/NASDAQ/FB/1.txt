Both Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) top and bottom lines soared past expectations. Indeed, year-over-year growth in both revenue and earnings per share actually accelerated compared to Q2.Here's a look at Facebook's breakneck growth, what's behind it, and what to expect next.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Table by author.Since last year, Facebook management has been warning that revenue growth would slow meaningfully in the second half of 2017 as one of its main drivers for advertising growth, increases in ad load, moderated. But instead revenue growth accelerated in Q3. Year-over-year revenue growth increased from 45% in Q2 to 47% in Q3, driven primarily by a 49% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue.Thanks to an expansion in the company's operating margin, from 44% in the year-ago quarter to 50% in Q3, Facebook's net income and earnings per share increased faster than revenue. The two metrics were up 79% and 77%, respectively.The biggest news regarding Facebook's updated outlook on Wednesday was its new forecasts for operating expenses.Facebook lowered its guidance for full-year growth in operating expenses. Management now expects expenses during 2017 to increase 35% to 40%, down from a previous forecast for a 40% to 45% year-over-year increase.Image source: Facebook.But Facebook is making up for this more conservative outlook for operating expenses in 2017 with a forecast for a huge jump in expenses in 2018. The company expects 2018 to be "a significant investment year," said Wehner during Facebook's earnings call. After clarifying that management hasn't finalized its 2018 budget yet, Wehner said he expects total 2018 operating expenses to increase 45% to 60% compared to 2017. This expense growth will be driven primarily by investments in security "to strengthen our systems and prevent abuse," aggressive investments in video content, and "long-term initiatives around augmented and virtual reality, AI, and connectivity," Wehner explained.Facebook similarly expects a sharp jump in capital expenditures in 2018, forecasting they will "roughly double from 2017 levels."Beyond Facebook's outlook for rising spending, management said it still expects revenue growth to decelerate in the coming quarters and in 2018.Daniel Sparks owns shares of Facebook.
