Menu Breaking news sponsored byFacebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) reports earnings on November 1 and investors are expecting big things.The consensus is it will earn $1.28 per share on revenue of $9.88 billion. That would represent growth of 41% on the top line, and 49% on the bottom line, compared with the same quarter a year ago. But analysts are whispering the earnings could come in at $1.40 per share, so expect the stock to rise into earnings.Facebook is already one of the hottest stocks on the market, rising 54% so far in 2017, more than doubling the return on the NASDAQ average. It has also kept rising as its price-to-earnings multiple has fallen, meaning it has justified speculators’ confidence.But investors don’t buy what you did. They buy what you are going to do. Does Facebook look better in the rear-view mirror?It’s important to note that the company isn’t just the Facebook service anymore.Facebook is Instagram. It’s Messenger.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL), growing 700% in the last five years against the House of Google’s 200%.FB’s gains have even doubled those of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) over that span, and founder Mark Zuckerberg is the only billionaire on the Forbes 400 list whose fortune has been able to keep up with that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, now the world’s richest person, in 2017. Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/facebook-inc-fb-better-rear-view-mirror/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
