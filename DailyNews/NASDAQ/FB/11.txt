Menu Breaking news sponsored bySource: ShutterstockFacebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is ready for a breakout. Despite being up nearly 59% so far this year, FB stock is in the midst of a short-term technical formation that could result in surprising gains heading into 2018.If you’re looking for a way to capitalize on gains in the FB stock price, I’ve got you covered.If you’re a regular here at InvestorPlace, you may have already heard about Facebook’s breakout potential. Bret Kenwell said as much recently when he delved into Facebook’s strong fundamentals and long-term technical uptrend.
Click to EnlargeAdding to Bret’s analysis, FB stock is nearing the end of a short-term cup-and-handle technical formation.Looking at a chart of FB, you can see the initiation of this pattern just after Facebook’s strong quarterly earnings report. The shares topped out near $183, and then proceeded to consolidate those gains during the rest of November.FB completed the “cup” portion of the pattern this week by once again challenging resistance near $183. The shares have now entered the “handle” phase, which is marked by a brief period of consolidation before the shares breakout sharply higher, as penned up buying power pushes FB stock past $183 and toward new highs.Short-term sentiment readings indicate that such a breakout could surprise more than a few pessimists next month. Specifically, the December put/call open interest ratio comes in at a 0.85, with puts nearly in parity with calls. That said, peak call OI of 58,000 contracts rests at the Dec $185 strike, meaning that some speculators are looking for a rally heading into expiration.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/collect-40-gain-on-facebook-inc-in-two-weeks/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
