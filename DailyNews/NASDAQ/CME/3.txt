(Symbol: ADP), according to The Online Investor  . Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true "apples-to-apples" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of CME Group (Symbol: CME), the market cap is now $49.38 billion, versus Automatic Data Processing Inc. (Symbol: ADP) at $49.32 billion.
