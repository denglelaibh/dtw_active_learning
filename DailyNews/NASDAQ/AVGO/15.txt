Menu Breaking news sponsored byFinally, some good news for Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM). After reaching a 52-week low in September, amid a battle with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and concerns about the mobile space, the QCOM stock price has soared. Qualcomm stock has gained about 33% just since late October.The driver, of course, has been acquisition interest from Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO). Broadcom has offered $70 per share for Qualcomm, an offer that was quickly rebuffed. But Broadcom since has reiterated its commitment to doing a deal, which likely means a higher bid is on the way at some point.If that deal comes, Qualcomm should take it. On its own, Qualcomm still has plenty of challenges and plenty of concerns. A sale in the $75-$80 per share range might seem like a disappointment, given that the QCOM stock price was above $80 back in 2014. But in this environment, a ~50% or higher premium to recent levels seems like a win for QCOM shareholders.Broadcom’s takeover for Qualcomm, at the rejected offer price, would be a $130-billion deal, the largest tech acquisition ever. But even that won’t be enough.In the release announcing its decision, Qualcomm cited two key points. The first was that the $70 per share offer “dramatically undervalues” the company. Second, Qualcomm wrote that such a deal “comes with significant regulatory uncertainty.”On the first point, I’m somewhat skeptical. I’ve been a long-time bear on QCOM stock — admittedly, that case doesn’t look great at the moment — and the risks here seem to support a valuation below even the current price. This is a company coming off a fiscal 2017 where year-over-year revenue declined 5%, and net income dropped 4%.Admittedly, the feud with Apple and the withheld royalties from both that company and Chinese customer Huawei had an impact. But it’s far too optimistic to see the Apple issues as a one-time event. Other tech giants have taken Apple’s side. Speculation persists that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) modems will replace Qualcomm in the iPhone going forward.There’s already been regulatory action in Korea and China, along with a U.S. probe. Qualcomm had to pay BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE:BB) $975 million to settle another dispute. Risks to the company’s actual business model are increasing.Getting 17-18x FY17 adjusted EPS in a market where INTC trades for ~14x net earnings and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) for ~7x seems like a win.Of course, the question is whether such a deal would pass regulatory muster. That’s likely one reason the QCOM stock price remains well below the rejected offer, even with another bid likely on the way.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/why-qualcomm-should-take-broadcoms-next-offer/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC
