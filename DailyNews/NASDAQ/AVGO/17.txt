QCOM AVGO INTC TSM Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report)	 recently announced the first-ever silicon-proven 7nm intellectual property (IP) targeting application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platform for deep learning and networking.The IP cores are built on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM  -  Free Report)	 7nm process technology. The on-die computation required for training and inference of deep learning applications is expected to benefit from ultra-high density logic and memory of the 7nm ASIC platform.The combination of CoWoS packaging and HBM2/3 PHY caters to high bandwidth memory interface required for next generation training in deep learning, high performance computing (HPC) and routing applications.The platform’s SerDes cores (112G and 56G SerDes) are beneficial for switching and routing applications and inter-node connections in HPC applications and deep learning. The IP portfolio also supports SoC integration for 5G requirements.We believe this to aid Broadcom’s top-line growth going ahead.Growth FactorsBroadcom stock has gained 55.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 40.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. The growth can be attributed to the company’s robust top-line growth and steady execution.Broadcom benefits from strong demand of its wireless solutions. Higher dollar content at the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s (Apple) next-gen platform (iPhone) is also a positive for the company. Robust industrial re-sales are also tailwinds.Notably, the company’s recent acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems is expected to boost Broadcom’s position in the storage area networking space.Broadcom is currently eyeing Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)	. The latter has already turned down the recent takeover bid of $130-billion (includes $25 billion of net debt) on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently a leading player in the chipset market. However, the company is planning to raise the bid amount for Qualcomm, per Reuters.We believe that Broadcom’s product portfolio, enhanced by the offerings of its acquired entities, is a major tailwind. However, increasing competition from industry peers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report)	 and Sumitomo remains a concern.Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) | Broadcom Limited QuoteZacks RankBroadcom has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.Visit performance for information about the performance numbers displayed above.Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.Real time prices by BATS.
