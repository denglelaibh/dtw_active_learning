Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope. Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha. Support is likely to come between $64.95 a share to $64.78 a share level.

The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line.
