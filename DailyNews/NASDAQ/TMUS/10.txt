To answer this, we will compare the two companies based on the strength of their growth, profitability, risk, returns, valuation, analyst recommendations, and insider trends.GrowthCompanies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run.

Profitability and ReturnsA high growth rate isn’t necessarily valuable to investors. In fact, companies that overinvest in low return projects just to achieve a high growth rate can actually destroy shareholder value. Profitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. We’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) to measure this. EBITDA margin of 27.79% for T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS). GSAT’s ROI is -7.70% while TMUS has a ROI of 6.00%. The interpretation is that TMUS’s business generates a higher return on investment than GSAT’s.Cash Flow

The amount of free cash flow available to investors is ultimately what determines the value of a stock. GSAT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.01. Comparatively, TMUS’s free cash flow per share was +1.04. On a percent-of-sales basis, GSAT’s free cash flow was 0.01% while TMUS converted 2.32% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, TMUS is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskLiquidity and leverage ratios are important because they reveal the financial health of a company. GSAT has a current ratio of 0.30 compared to 0.90 for TMUS. This means that TMUS can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. GSAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 2.85 versus a D/E of 1.52 for TMUS. GSAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationGSAT trades at a P/B of 9.41, and a P/S of 17.67, compared to a forward P/E of 22.59, a P/B of 2.53, and a P/S of 1.28 for TMUS. GSAT is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings basis but is expensive in terms of P/B and P/S ratio. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsA cheap stock isn’t a good investment if the stock is priced accurately. To get a sense of “value” we must compare the current price to some measure of intrinsic value such as a price target. GSAT is currently priced at a -36% to its one-year price target of 2.50. Comparatively, TMUS is -13.4% relative to its price target of 71.22. This suggests that GSAT is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.00 for GSAT and 2.00 for TMUS, which implies that analysts are equally bullish on their outlook for the two stocks.Risk and VolatilityBeta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. GSAT has a beta of 2.54 and TMUS’s beta is 0.41. TMUS’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentShort interest, or the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted, is another metric investors use to get a pulse on sentiment.GSAT has a short ratio of 20.85 compared to a short interest of 5.39 for TMUS. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for TMUS.SummaryT-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) beats Globalstar, Inc.
